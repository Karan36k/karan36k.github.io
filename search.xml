<h2 id="Four-modes-of-vim"><a href="#Four-modes-of-vim" class="headerlink" title="Four modes of vim"></a>Four modes of vim</h2><ol>
<li><p>General mode: normal mode. You can move the cursor, delete characters or entire lines, and copy and paste file data. Opening vim is to enter this mode, and the switching between the three modes is also transferred here.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Edit mode: In general mode, press any one of <code>i``I``o`` O</code> <code>a`` A</code> <code>r`` R</code> <code>s`` S</code> to enter this mode. You can edit the content of the file and press Esc to return to the normal mode.</p>
<p> -<code>i`` I</code> is insert (in front of the character under the cursor and at the beginning of the line)<br> -<code>o`` O</code> is open new line (start a new line below the line where the cursor is and start a new line above the line where the cursor is<br> -<code>a`` A</code> is append (after the character under the cursor and at the end of the line where the cursor is)<br> -<code>s`` S</code> is to delete (the character where the cursor is and start inserting and the line where the cursor is and start inserting), that is, substitute replacement.<br> -<code>r`` R</code> is to replace the character under the cursor and become the replacement mode</p>
</li>
<li><p>Command line mode: Press <code>:</code> <code>/</code> <code>in normal mode?</code>Any one enters this mode (the meaning of these symbols will be described below). You can find data operations, read, save, replace a lot of characters, leave vim, display line number and other operations, press Esc to return to the general mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Visual mode: In general mode, press <code>v`` V</code> <code>ctr + v</code> to enter the visual mode, which is equivalent to the normal mode after highlighting the selected text, that is, in this mode, you can arbitrarily select a specific area and be The selected area is highlighted, <code>v</code> selects the unit: one character;<code>V</code> is also called the visible line mode, select the unit: line; <code>ctr + v</code> is also called the visible block mode, select the unit: square ; All three are useful, see below for details.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Mobile"><a href="#Mobile" class="headerlink" title="Mobile"></a>Mobile</h2><p>In normal mode:</p>
<p><code>w</code> → to the beginning of the next word<code>e</code> → to the end of the next word (words are separated by spaces by default)<br><code>W</code> → to the beginning of the next string<code>E</code> → to the end of the next string (a string refers to a string consisting of numbers, letters, and underscores)<br><code>B</code> → Go to the first character of the previous string. The<code>b</code> → “command moves the cursor to the first character of the previous word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default, a word is composed of letters, numbers and underscores<br>If you think words are separated by blank characters, then you need to use uppercase E and W (Chen Hao: Note)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>0</code> → number zero, to the beginning of the line<br><code>^</code> → Go to the first position of the line that is not a blank character (the so-called blank character is a space, tab, line feed, carriage return, etc.)<br><code>$</code> → Go to the end of the line<br><code>g_</code> → to the last position of the line that is not a blank character<br><code>%</code> → Go to the other of the pair of brackets where the cursor is<br><code>gg</code> → first line<br><code>G</code> → last line<br><code>h`` j</code> <code>k`` l</code> (strong examples recommend using it to move the cursor, but it is not necessary) → you can also use the cursor keys (← ↓ ↑ →). Note: j extends downwards, k extends upwards</p>
<ol>
<li>** High frequency usage scenario 1 **: Change a variable name in the line first and move the cursor: <code>w</code> and<code>b</code>, <code>W</code> and<code>B</code> (or if the line is too long, use the following Search function) to the target word</li>
<li>** High frequency usage scenario 2 **: Modify the indent and jump to the beginning of the line<code>^</code></li>
<li>** High frequency usage scenario 3 **: View the completeness of the function or class or the variable scope <code>%</code></li>
<li>** High frequency usage scenario 4 **: After splitting the screen, jump to different windows: <code>ctrl + w + (h or j or k or l)</code></li>
<li>** High-frequency use scene 5 **: Move left (left, top, right) <code>(h, j, k, l)</code></li>
<li>** High frequency usage scenario 6 **: Delete to the end: <code>d $</code> Delete to the beginning: <code>d ^</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Tag"><a href="#Tag" class="headerlink" title="Tag"></a>Tag</h3><p>Note: ** mark is to find better **, in normal mode:</p>
<p><code>mx</code> meaning: mark x, x is the name of mark;<br><code>&#39;x</code> meaning: go to the position of x mark</p>
<ol>
<li>** High-frequency usage scenario 1: ** You can see how to define other functions in the function. You want to see how to define them. After you read it, you need to come back. Then mark it first, and then jump back.</li>

<p>The asterisk * and plus sign + pasteboard are system pasteboards. Under Windows, * and + clipboards are the same. For X11 systems, * the clipboard stores the selected or highlighted content, and the clipboard stores the copied or cut content. Open the clipboard option, you can access + clipboard; open xterm_clipboard, you can access * clipboard. * One function of the clipboard is that the content selected in one window of vim can be taken out in another window of vim.</p>

<h2 id="vim-encoding"><a href="#vim-encoding" class="headerlink" title="vim encoding"></a>vim encoding</h2><p>Vim can edit all kinds of character encoding files very well, which of course includes popular Unicode encoding methods such as UCS-2 and UTF-8.</p>
<p>Four character encoding options, encoding, fileencoding, fileencodings, and termencoding (for possible values ​​of these options, please refer to Vim online help: help encoding-names, their meanings are as follows:</p>
<p>-** encoding **: The character encoding used internally by Vim</p>
<p>Including Vim’s buffer (buffer), menu text, message text, etc. The default is to choose according to your locale. The user manual recommends changing its value only in .vimrc. In fact, it seems that it only makes sense to change its value in .vimrc. You can use another encoding to edit and save the file. For example, the encoding of your vim is utf-8, and the edited file uses cp936 encoding. Understand the way), and when you write a file, it will automatically switch back to cp936 (the file save encoding).</p>
<p>-** fileencoding **: The character encoding of the currently edited file in Vim</p>
<p>When Vim saves the file, it will also save the file in this character encoding (regardless of whether it is a new file).</p>
<p>-** fileencodings **: Vim will automatically detect encoding settings</p>
<p>When starting, it will detect the character encoding mode of the file to be opened one by one according to the character encoding mode listed in it, and set fileencoding to the character encoding mode finally detected. Therefore, it is best to put the Unicode encoding at the front of this list, and the Latin encoding at the end.</p>
<p>-** termencoding **: The character encoding method of the terminal (or Windows console window) that Vim works on</p>
<p>If the term where vim is located is the same as the vim encoding, you do not need to set it. If it is not the case, you can use vim’s termencoding option to automatically convert to term encoding. This option is not valid for gVim in our common GUI mode under Windows, and for Console mode Vim is the code page of the Windows console, and Usually we don’t need to change it. Okay, after explaining this bunch of parameters that can easily confuse novices, let’s take a look at how Vim’s multi-character encoding support works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Vim, and set the character encoding of buffer, menu text, and message according to the encoding value set in .vimrc.</li>
<li>Read the file to be edited and detect the file encoding method one by one according to the character encoding methods listed in fileencodings. And set fileencoding to be detected, it looks correct (Note 1) Character encoding.</li>
<li>Compare the values ​​of fileencoding and encoding. If they are different, call iconv to convert the file content to the character encoding method described by encoding, and put the converted content into the buffer developed for this file. At this time, we can start editing This file. Note that to complete this step, you need to call external iconv.dll (Note 2). You need to ensure that this file exists in $ VIMRUNTIME or other directories listed in the PATH environment variable.</li>
<li>When saving the file after editing, compare the values ​​of fileencoding and encoding again. If they are different, call iconv again to convert the text in the buffer to be saved to the character encoding described in fileencoding and save it to the specified file. Similarly, this requires calling iconv.dll. Because Unicode can contain characters of almost all languages, and UTF-8 encoding of Unicode is a very cost-effective encoding (space consumption is less than UCS-2), so the value of encoding is recommended. Set to utf-8. Another reason for this is that when encoding is set to utf-8, Vim automatically detects the encoding of the file to be more accurate (perhaps the main reason;). For the files we edit in Chinese Windows, in order to take into account compatibility with other software, the file encoding is still set to GB2312 / GBK, so fileencoding is recommended to be set to Chinese (chinese is an individual name, which means gb2312 in Unix and Windows cp936, which is the code page of GBK).</li>
</ol>
<p>For fedora, vim settings are generally placed in the / etc / vimrc file, however, it is recommended not to modify it. You can modify the ~ / .vimrc file (which does not exist by default, you can create a new one yourself) and write the desired settings.</p>
<p>My .vimrc file is as follows:</p>
<p><code>`
: set encoding = utf-8
: set fileencodings = ucs-bom, utf-8, cp936
: set fileencoding = gb2312
: set termencoding = utf-8</code> `</p>
<p>Among them, the fileencoding configuration can set utf-8, but my mp3 does not seem to support utf-8 encoding, so simply, I set it to gb2312. Now it’s done, no matter whether it is in vi or mp3, it can display .txt files without garbled characters.</p>

<h2 id="Forward-and-backward-function"><a href="#Forward-and-backward-function" class="headerlink" title="Forward and backward function"></a>Forward and backward function</h2><p>Popular text editors usually have forward and backward functions, and can move back and forth between the positions that have been viewed in the file (associated with the browser), use <code>Ctrl-O</code> in vim to perform backwards, use<code>Ctrl-I</code>Execute forward, related help:<code>: help CTRL-O</code> <code>: help CTRL-I``: help jump-motions</code></p>

Vim’s diff mode is dependent on the diff command.</p>
<code>`shell
 vimdiff file1 file2 [file3 [file4]]</code> <code>or
``</code>shell<br>vim -d file1 file2 [file3 [file4]]<br><code>`
The window is more localized in the current tab. You cannot see the difference between a window and the windows in other tabs. In this way, multiple groups of comparison windows can be opened at the same time, and each group of differences is in a separate tab. Vim will open a window for each file and use ** vertical split ** just like the `-O` parameter. If you want to ** split horizontally **, add the `-o` parameter:</code> <code>shell
vimdiff -o file1 file2 [file3 [file4]]
``</code><br>If you are already in Vim, you can enter compare mode in three ways, only one is introduced:<br><code>`
: diffs [plit] {filename}</code> <code>Open a new window for {filename}. The current and newly opened windows will have the same parameters as &quot;vimdiff&quot;. To split the window vertically, add</code>: vertical<code>in front. E.g: <dl><dt>``</code></dt><dd>vert diffsplit another_filename<br>`` `</dd></dl><h3 id="Jump-to-the-difference"><a href="#Jump-to-the-difference" class="headerlink" title="Jump to the difference"></a>Jump to the difference</h3><p>There are two commands that can be used to jump to the location of the difference text:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>[c</code> jumps backwards to the beginning of the last change. Count the prefix so that it repeats the corresponding times.</li>
<li><code>] c</code> jumps forward to the beginning of the next change. Count the prefix so that it repeats the corresponding times.<br> If there is no change to which the cursor can jump, an error will be generated.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Merge"><a href="#Merge" class="headerlink" title="Merge"></a>Merge</h3><p>The purpose of comparison is to merge the differences and directly use the following built-in commands or troublesome methods: manually copy from one window to another.</p>
<dl><dt>`` `<br>: [range] diffg [et] [bufspec]<br>                Use another buffer to modify the current buffer to eliminate differences. Unless there is only another<br>                For a buffer in comparison mode, [bufspec] must exist and specify that buffer.<br>                If [bufspec] specifies the current buffer, it is an empty action. [range] can refer to the following.</dt><dd>[range] diffpu [t] [bufspec]<br>                Use the current buffer to modify another buffer, eliminating differences.<br>[count] do Same as “: diffget”, but no scope. “o” means “obtain” (not available<br>                “dg” because that may be the beginning of “dgg”! ).<br>dp Same as “: diffput”, but no range. Note Not applicable in visual mode.<br>                The given [count] is used as the [bufspec] parameter of “: diffput”.</dd></dl><p>When [range] is not given, only the difference text at the current cursor position or immediately above it will be affected.<br>When [range] is specified, Vim tries to change only the lines it specifies. However, this is not always effective when there are deleted rows.<br>The parameter [bufspec] can be the serial number of the buffer, matching the pattern of the buffer name or part of the buffer name.<br>E.g:<br>        : diffget uses another buffer to enter compare mode<br>        : diffget 3 uses buffer 3<br>        : diffget v2 uses a buffer whose name matches “v2” and enters the comparison mode (for example, “file.c.v2”)<br>`` `</p>
<h3 id="Update-comparison-and-undo-changes"><a href="#Update-comparison-and-undo-changes" class="headerlink" title="Update comparison and undo changes"></a>Update comparison and undo changes</h3><p>Compare the contents based on the buffer. Therefore, if you have made changes after loading the file, these changes will also participate in the comparison. However, you may want to use <code>: diffupdate [!]</code> From time to time. Because not all changes can be automatically updated. When <code>!</code> Is included, Vim checks whether the file has been changed externally and needs to be reloaded. Prompt for each changed file.</p>
<p>If you want to undo the modification, you can enter the normal mode directly and press <code>u</code> as you normally do in vim editing, but you must be careful to move the cursor to the file window that needs to be undoed.</p>
<h3 id="Expand-and-view-context"><a href="#Expand-and-view-context" class="headerlink" title="Expand and view context"></a>Expand and view context</h3><p>When comparing and merging files, it is often necessary to combine context to determine the final action to be taken. By default, Vimdiff will display 6 lines of text above and below the difference for reference. Other identical lines of text are automatically folded. If you want to modify the default number of context lines, you can set it like this:</p>
<p> <code>`
: set diffopt = context: 3</code> `</p>
<h3 id="Exit-of-multiple-files"><a href="#Exit-of-multiple-files" class="headerlink" title="Exit of multiple files"></a>Exit of multiple files</h3><p>After comparing and merging to a conclusion, you can use the following commands to operate on multiple files at the same time.</p>
<p>For example, quit at the same time: <code>: qa (quit all)</code></p>
<p>If you want to save all files: <code>: wa (write all)</code></p>
<p>Or a merge command of the two, save all files, and then exit: <code>: wqa (write, then quit all)</code></p>
<p>If you do not want to save the result of any operation when you quit: <code>: qa! (Force to quit all)</code></p>
