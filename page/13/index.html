          <p>By now you have seen a lot of different learning algorithms. And if you’ve been following along these videos you should consider yourself an expert on many state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. <strong>But even among people that know a certain learning algorithm. There’s often a huge difference between someone that really knows how to powerfully and effectively apply that algorithm, versus someone that’s less familiar with some of the material that I’m about to teach and who doesn’t really understand how to apply these algorithms and can end up wasting a lot of their time trying things out that don’t really make sense.</strong></p>
<p>What I would like to do is make sure that if you are developing machine learning systems, that you know how to choose one of the most promising avenues to spend your time pursuing. And on this and the next few videos I’m going to give a number of practical suggestions, advice, guidelines on how to do that. </p>
<p>And concretely what we’d focus on is the problem of, suppose you are developing a machine learning system or trying to improve the performance of a machine learning system, how do you go about deciding what are the proxy avenues to try next? </p>
<p>To explain this, let’s continue using our example of learning to predict housing prices. And let’s say you’ve implement and regularize linear regression. Thus minimizing that cost function j.  Now suppose that after you take your learn parameters, if you test your hypothesis on the new set of houses, suppose you find that this is making huge errors in this prediction of the housing prices. The question is what should you then try mixing in order to improve the learning algorithm? </p>
<p>There are many things that one can think of that could improve the performance of the learning algorithm. </p>
<p>One thing they could try, is to get more training examples. And concretely, you can imagine, maybe, you know, setting up phone surveys, going door to door, to try to get more data on how much different houses sell for. And the sad thing is I’ve seen a lot of people spend a lot of time collecting more training examples, thinking oh, if we have twice as much or ten times as much training data, that is certainly going to help, right? <strong>But sometimes getting more training data doesn’t actually help and in the next few videos we will see why, and we will see how you can avoid spending a lot of time collecting more training data in settings where it is just not going to help.</strong> </p>
<p>Other things you might try are to well maybe try a smaller set of features. So if you have some set of features such as x1, x2, x3 and so on, maybe a large number of features. Maybe you want to spend time carefully selecting some small subset of them to prevent overfitting. Or maybe you need to get additional features. Maybe the current set of features aren’t informative enough and you want to collect more data in the sense of getting more features. </p>
<p>And once again this is the sort of project that can scale up the huge projects can you imagine getting phone surveys to find out more houses, or extra land surveys to find out more about the pieces of land and so on, so a huge project. And once again it would be nice to know in advance if this is going to help before we spend a lot of time doing something like this. We can also try adding polynomial features things like x2 square x2 square and product features x1, x2. We can still spend quite a lot of time thinking about that and we can also try other things like decreasing lambda, the regularization parameter or increasing lambda. Given a menu of options like these, some of which can easily scale up to six month or longer projects. </p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, the most common method that people use to pick one of these is to go by</strong> <strong><em>gut feeling</em></strong>. In which what many people will do is sort of randomly pick one of these options and maybe say, “Oh, lets go and get more training data.” And easily spend six months collecting more training data or maybe someone else would rather be saying, “Well, let’s go collect a lot more features on these houses in our data set.” And I have a lot of times, sadly seen people spend, you know, literally 6 months doing one of these avenues that they have sort of at random only to discover six months later that that really wasn’t a promising avenue to pursue. </p>
<p><strong>Fortunately, there is a pretty simple technique that can let you very quickly rule out half of the things on this list as being potentially promising things to pursue.</strong> And there is a very simple technique, that if you run, can easily rule out many of these options, and potentially save you a lot of time pursuing something that’s just is not going to work. </p>
<p>In the next two videos after this, I’m going to first talk about <strong>how to evaluate learning algorithms</strong>. And in the next few videos after that, I’m going to talk about these techniques, which are called <strong>the machine learning diagnostics</strong>. And what a diagnostic is, is a test you can run, to get insight into what is or isn’t working with an algorithm, and which will often give you insight as to what are promising things to try to improve a learning algorithm’s performance. We’ll talk about specific diagnostics later in this video sequence. But I should mention in advance that diagnostics can take time to implement and can sometimes, you know, take quite a lot of time to implement and understand but doing so can be a very good use of your time when you are developing learning algorithms because they can often save you from spending many months pursuing an avenue that you could have found out much earlier just was not going to be fruitful. So in the next few videos, I’m going to first talk about how evaluate your learning algorithms and after that I’m going to talk about some of these diagnostics which will hopefully let you much more effectively select more of the useful things to try mixing if your goal to improve the machine learning system.</p>
<h1 id="01-evaluating-a-learning-algorithm"><a href="#01-evaluating-a-learning-algorithm" class="headerlink" title="01_evaluating-a-learning-algorithm"></a>01_evaluating-a-learning-algorithm</h1><h2 id="Evaluating-a-Hypothesis"><a href="#Evaluating-a-Hypothesis" class="headerlink" title="Evaluating a Hypothesis"></a>Evaluating a Hypothesis</h2><p>Once we have done some trouble shooting for errors in our predictions by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Getting more training examples</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trying smaller sets of features</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trying additional features</p>
</li>
<li><p>Trying polynomial features</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increasing or decreasing λ</p>
<p>We can move on to evaluate our new hypothesis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A hypothesis may have a low error for the training examples but still be inaccurate (because of overfitting). Thus, to evaluate a hypothesis, given a dataset of training examples, we can split up the data into two sets: a <strong>training set</strong> and a <strong>test set</strong> . Typically, the training set consists of 70 % of your data and the test set is the remaining 30 %.</p>
<p>The new procedure using these two sets is then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn $\Theta$ and minimize $J_{train}(\Theta)$  using the training set</li>
<li>Compute the test set error $J_{test}(\Theta)$</li>
</ol>
<p>The test set error For linear regression: $J_{test}(\Theta) = \dfrac{1}{2m_{test}} \sum_{i=1}^{m_{test}}(h_\Theta(x^{(i)}<em>{test}) - y^{(i)}</em>{test})^2$</p>
<p>For classification ~ Misclassification error (aka 0/1 misclassification error):  </p>
<p> $$err(h_\Theta(x),y) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \mbox{if } h_\Theta(x) \geq 0.5\ and\ y = 0\ or\ h_\Theta(x) &lt; 0.5\ and\ y = 1\newline 0 &amp; \mbox otherwise \end{cases}$$</p>
<p>This gives us a binary 0 or 1 error result based on a misclassification. The average test error for the test set is:</p>
<p>$$\text{Test Error} = \dfrac{1}{m_{test}} \sum^{m_{test}}<em>{i=1} err(h_\Theta(x^{(i)}</em>{test}), y^{(i)}_{test})$$</p>
<p>This gives us the proportion of the test data that was misclassified.</p>
<h2 id="Model-Selection-and-Train-Validation-Test-Sets"><a href="#Model-Selection-and-Train-Validation-Test-Sets" class="headerlink" title="Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets"></a>Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets</h2><p>Just because a learning algorithm fits a training set well, that does not mean it is a good hypothesis. It could <strong><em>overfit</em></strong> and as a result your predictions on the test set would be poor. <strong><em>The error of your hypothesis as measured on the data set with which you trained the parameters will be lower than the error on any other data set.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Given many models with different polynomial degrees, we can use a systematic approach to identify the ‘best’ function. In order to choose the model of your hypothesis, you can test each degree of polynomial and look at the error result.</strong> </p>
<p>One way to break down our dataset into the three sets is:  </p>
<ul>
<li>​    Training set: 60%   </li>
<li>​    Cross validation set: 20%   </li>
<li>​    Test set: 20%   </li>
</ul>
<p>We can now calculate three separate error values for the three different sets using the following method: </p>
<ol>
<li>​    Optimize the parameters in $Θ $ using the training set for each polynomial degree.   </li>
<li>​    Find the polynomial degree d with the least error using the cross validation set.   </li>
<li>​    Estimate the generalization error using the test set with $J_{test}(Θ^{(d)})$, (d = theta from polynomial with lower error);   </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This way, the degree of the polynomial d has not been trained using the test set.</strong></p>
<p><em>Training error:</em><br>$$J_{train}\left(\theta\right) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_\limits{i=1}^{m}\left(h_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)}\right)-y^{(i)}\right)^2$$<br><em>Cross Validation error:</em><br>$$J_{cv}\left(\theta\right) = \frac{1}{2m_{cv}}\sum_\limits{i=1}^{m}\left(h_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)}<em>{cv}\right)-y^{(i)}</em>{cv}\right)^2$$<br><em>Test error:</em><br>$$J_{cv}\left(\theta\right) = \frac{1}{2m_{cv}}\sum_\limits{i=1}^{m}\left(h_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)}<em>{cv}\right)-y^{(i)}</em>{cv}\right)^2$$</p>
<h1 id="02-bias-vs-variance"><a href="#02-bias-vs-variance" class="headerlink" title="02_bias-vs-variance"></a>02_bias-vs-variance</h1><h2 id="Diagnosing-Bias-vs-Variance"><a href="#Diagnosing-Bias-vs-Variance" class="headerlink" title="Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance"></a>Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance</h2><p>In this section we examine the relationship between the degree of the polynomial d and the underfitting or overfitting of our hypothesis.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to distinguish whether <strong>bias</strong> or <strong>variance</strong> is the problem contributing to bad predictions.   </li>
<li>High bias is underfitting and high variance is overfitting. Ideally, we need to find a golden mean between these two.   </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/10/1.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>The training error will tend to <strong>decrease</strong> as we increase the degree d of the polynomial. </p>
<p>At the same time, the cross validation error will tend to <strong>decrease</strong> as we increase d up to a point, and then it will <strong>increase</strong> as d is increased, forming a convex curve. </p>

<p>In the figure above, we see that as $\lambda$ increases, our fit becomes more rigid. On the other hand, as $\lambda$ approaches 0, we tend to over overfit the data. So how do we choose our parameter $\lambda$ to get it ‘just right’ ? In order to choose the model and the regularization term $λ$ , we need to: </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/10/6.png" alt="img"></p>
<ol>
<li>Create a list of lambdas (i.e.$ λ∈{0,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.08,0.16,0.32,0.64,1.28,2.56,5.12,10.24}$);   </li>
<li>Create a set of models with different degrees or any other variants.   </li>
<li><strong><em>Iterate through the $\lambda$s and for each $\lambda$ go through all the models to learn some $\Theta$ .</em></strong></li>
<li>Compute the cross validation error using the learned $Θ$ (computed with $λ$) on the $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ <strong>without</strong> regularization or $λ = 0$.   </li>
<li>Select the best combo that produces the lowest error on the cross validation set.   </li>
<li>Using the best combo $Θ$ and λ, apply it on $J_{test}(\Theta)$ to see if it has a good generalization of the problem.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Learning-Curves"><a href="#Learning-Curves" class="headerlink" title="Learning Curves"></a>Learning Curves</h2><p>Training an algorithm on a very few number of data points (such as 1, 2 or 3) will easily have 0 errors because we can always find a quadratic curve that touches exactly those number of points. Hence:</p>
<p>As the training set gets larger, the error for a quadratic function increases.</p>
<p>The error value will plateau out after a certain m, or training set size.</p>
<p><strong>Experiencing high bias:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Low training set size</strong>  : causes $J_{train}(\Theta)$ to be low and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ to be high. </p>
<p><strong>Large training set size</strong> : causes both $J_{train}(\Theta)$ and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ to be high with $J_{train}(\Theta)$≈$J_{CV}(\Theta)$.</p>
<p>If a learning algorithm is suffering from <strong>high bias</strong>, getting more training data will not <strong>(by itself)</strong> help much.</p>

<p><strong>Experiencing high variance:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Low training set size</strong> : $J_{train}(\Theta)$ will be low and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ will be high.</p>
<p><strong>Large training set size</strong>: $J_{train}(\Theta)$ increases with training set size and $J_{CV} (\Theta$) continues to decrease without leveling off. Also, $J_{train}(\Theta)$ &lt; $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ but the difference between them remains significant.</p>
<p>If a learning algorithm is suffering from <strong>high variance</strong>, getting more training data is likely to help.</p>

<ul>
<li>​         <strong>Getting more training examples:</strong> Fixes high variance   </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>​         <strong>Trying smaller sets of features:</strong> Fixes high variance   </li>

<li>A neural network with fewer parameters is <strong>prone to underfitting</strong>. It is also <strong>computationally cheaper</strong>. </li>
<li>A large neural network with more parameters is <strong>prone to overfitting</strong>. It is also <strong>computationally expensive</strong>. In this case you can use regularization (increase λ) to address the overfitting.   </li>

<p>Using a single hidden layer is a good starting default. You can train your neural network on a number of hidden layers using your cross validation set. You can then select the one that performs best. </p>
<p><strong>Model Complexity Effects:</strong>    </p>
<ul>
<li>Lower-order polynomials (low model complexity) have high bias and low variance. In this case, the model fits poorly consistently.   </li>
<li>Higher-order polynomials (high model complexity) fit the training data extremely well and the test data extremely poorly. These have low bias on the training data, but very high variance.   </li>
<li>In reality, we would want to choose a model somewhere in between, that can generalize well but also fits the data reasonably well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Model-Selection"><a href="#Model-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Model Selection"></a>Model Selection</h2><p>Choosing M the order of polynomials.<br>How can we tell which parameters Θ to leave in the model (known as “model selection”)?<br>There are several ways to solve this problem: </p>
<ul>
<li>Get more data (very difficult). </li>
<li>Choose the model which best fits the data without overfitting (very difficult). </li>
<li>Reduce the opportunity for overfitting through regularization .</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bias: approximation error (Difference between expected value and optimal value)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High Bias = UnderFitting (BU) </li>
<li>$J_{train}(\Theta)$ and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ both will be high and $J_{train}(\Theta)$ ≈ $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Variance: estimation error due to finite data</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High Variance = OverFitting (VO) </li>
<li>$J_{train}(\Theta)$ is low and $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ ≫$J_{train}(\Theta)$ </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intuition for the bias-variance trade-off:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Complex model =&gt; sensitive to data =&gt; much affected by changes in X =&gt; high variance, low bias. </li>
<li>Simple model =&gt; more rigid =&gt; does not change as much with changes in X =&gt; low variance, high bias. </li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most important goals in learning: finding a model that is just right in the bias-variance trade-off. </p>
<p><strong>Regularization Effects:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Small values of λ allow model to become finely tuned to noise leading to large variance =&gt; overfitting. </li>
<li>Large values of λ pull weight parameters to zero leading to large bias =&gt; underfitting. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Model Complexity Effects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lower-order polynomials (low model complexity) have high bias and low variance. In this case, the model fits poorly consistently. </li>
<li>Higher-order polynomials (high model complexity) fit the training data extremely well and the test data extremely poorly. These have low bias on the training data, but very high variance. </li>
<li>In reality, we would want to choose a model somewhere in between, that can generalize well but also fits the data reasonably well. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A typical rule of thumb when running diagnostics is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More training examples fixes high variance but not high bias. </li>
<li>Fewer features fixes high variance but not high bias. </li>
<li>Additional features fixes high bias but not high variance. </li>
<li>The addition of polynomial and interaction features fixes high bias but not high variance. </li>
<li>When using gradient descent, decreasing lambda can fix high bias and increasing lambda can fix high variance (lambda is the regularization parameter). </li>
<li>When using neural networks, small neural networks are more prone to under-fitting and big neural networks are prone to over-fitting. Cross-validation of network size is a way to choose alternatives. </li>

<h2 id="Cost-Function"><a href="#Cost-Function" class="headerlink" title="Cost Function"></a>Cost Function</h2><p>Let’s first define a few variables that we will need to use: </p>
<ul>
<li>​    L = total number of layers in the network   </li>
<li>​    $s_l$ = number of units (not counting bias unit) in layer l   </li>
<li>​    K = number of output units/classes   </li>
</ul>
<p>Recall that in neural networks, we may have many output nodes. We denote $h_Θ(x)<em>k$ as being a hypothesis that results in the $k^{th}$output. Our cost function for neural networks is going to be a generalization of the one we used for logistic regression. Recall that the cost function for regularized logistic regression was :<br>$$<br>J(\theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum</em>{i=1}^m [ y^{(i)}\ \log (h_\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\ \log (1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))] + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2<br>$$<br>For neural networks, it is going to be slightly more complicated :<br>$$<br>\begin{gather<em>} J(\Theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^K \left[y^{(i)}<em>k \log ((h_\Theta (x^{(i)}))_k) + (1 - y^{(i)}_k)\log (1 - (h_\Theta(x^{(i)}))_k)\right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum</em>{l=1}^{L-1} \sum_{i=1}^{s_l} \sum_{j=1}^{s_{l+1}} ( \Theta_{j,i}^{(l)})^2\end{gather</em>}<br>$$<br>We have added a few nested summations to account for our multiple output nodes. In the first part of the equation, before the square brackets, we have an additional nested summation that loops through the number of output nodes. </p>
<p><strong>In the regularization part, after the square brackets, we must account for multiple theta matrices. The number of columns in our current theta matrix is equal to the number of nodes in our current layer (including the bias unit). The number of rows in our current theta matrix is equal to the number of nodes in the next layer (excluding the bias unit).</strong> As before with logistic regression, we square every term. </p>
<p>Note:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>the double sum simply adds up the logistic regression costs calculated for each cell in the output layer</em></strong>   </li>
<li><strong><em>the triple sum simply adds up the squares of all the individual $Θ_s$ in the entire network.</em></strong></li>
<li>the i in the triple sum does <strong>not</strong> refer to training example i .</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Backpropagation-Algorithm"><a href="#Backpropagation-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Backpropagation Algorithm"></a>Backpropagation Algorithm</h2><p>“Backpropagation” is neural-network terminology for minimizing our cost function, just like what we were doing with gradient descent in logistic and linear regression. Our goal is to compute:<br>$$<br>\min_\Theta J(\Theta)<br>$$<br>That is, we want to minimize our cost function $J$ using an optimal set of parameters in theta. In this section we’ll look at the equations we use to compute the partial derivative of $J(Θ)$:<br>$$<br>\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \Theta_{i,j}^{(l)}}J(\Theta)<br>$$<br>To do so, we use the following algorithm:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/09/2.png" alt="backpropagation_algorithm"></p>
<p><strong>Back propagation Algorithm</strong>   </p>
<p>Given training set $\lbrace (x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}) \cdots (x^{(m)}, y^{(m)})\rbrace$</p>
<p>Set $\Delta^{(l)}_{i,j}$ := 0 for all (l,i,j), (hence you end up having a matrix full of zeros)   </p>
<p> For training example t =1 to m: </p>
<ol>
<li>Set $a^{(1)} := x^{(t)}$</li>
<li>Perform forward propagation to compute $a^{(l)}$ for l=2,3,…,L   </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/09/3.png" alt="forward_propagation"><br>3.  Using $y^{(t)}$, compute $\delta^{(L)} = a^{(L)} - y^{(t)}$ </p>
<p>Where L is our total number of layers and $a^{(L)}$ is the vector of outputs of the activation units for the last layer. So our “error values” for the last layer are simply the differences of our actual results in the last layer and the correct outputs in y. To get the delta values of the layers before the last layer, we can use an equation that steps us back from right to left :<br>4.  Compute $\delta^{(L-1)}, \delta^{(L-2)},\dots,\delta^{(2)}$ using $\delta^{(l)} = ((\Theta^{(l)})^T \delta^{(l+1)})\ .<em>\ a^{(l)}\ .</em>\ (1 - a^{(l)})$ </p>
<p>The delta values of layer l are calculated by multiplying the delta values in the next layer with the theta matrix of layer l. We then element-wise multiply that with a function called g’, or g-prime, which is the derivative of the activation function g evaluated with the input values given by $z^{(l)}$. </p>
<p>  The g-prime derivative terms can also be written out as: </p>
<p>$$g’(z^{(l)}) = a^{(l)}\ .*\ (1 - a^{(l)})$$<br>5. $\Delta^{(l)}<em>{i,j} := \Delta^{(l)}</em>{i,j} + a_j^{(l)} \delta_i^{(l+1)}$ or with vectorization, $\Delta^{(l)} := \Delta^{(l)} + \delta^{(l+1)}(a^{(l)})^T$ </p>
<p>  Hence we update our new $\Delta$ matrix. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>$D^{(l)}<em>{i,j} := \dfrac{1}{m}\left(\Delta^{(l)}</em>{i,j} + \lambda\Theta^{(l)}_{i,j}\right)$, if j≠0.   </p>
</li>
<li><p>$D^{(l)}<em>{i,j} := \dfrac{1}{m}\Delta^{(l)}</em>{i,j}$ If j=0   </p>
<p>The capital-delta matrix D is used as an “accumulator” to add up our values as we go along and eventually compute our partial derivative. Thus we get $\frac \partial {\partial \Theta_{ij}^{(l)}} J(\Theta)$= $D_{ij}^{(l)}$</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Backpropagation-Intuition"><a href="#Backpropagation-Intuition" class="headerlink" title="Backpropagation Intuition"></a>Backpropagation Intuition</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong>    [4:39, the last term for the calculation for $z^3_1$ (three-color handwritten formula) should be $a^2_2$ instead of $a^2_1$. 6:08 - the equation for cost(i) is incorrect. The first term is missing parentheses for the log() function, and the second term should be $(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-h{_\theta}{(x^{(i)}}))$. 8:50 - $\delta^{(4)} = y - a^{(4)}$ is incorrect and should be $\delta^{(4)} = a^{(4)} - y$.]  </p>
<p>Recall that the cost function for a neural network is:  </p>
<p>$$\begin{gather<em>}J(\Theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{t=1}^m\sum_{k=1}^K \left[ y^{(t)}<em>k \ \log (h_\Theta (x^{(t)}))_k + (1 - y^{(t)}_k)\ \log (1 - h_\Theta(x^{(t)})_k)\right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum</em>{l=1}^{L-1} \sum_{i=1}^{s_l} \sum_{j=1}^{s_l+1} ( \Theta_{j,i}^{(l)})^2\end{gather</em>}$$</p>
<p>If we consider simple non-multiclass classification (k = 1) and disregard regularization, the cost is computed with: </p>
<p>$$cost(t) =y^{(t)} \ \log (h_\Theta (x^{(t)})) + (1 - y^{(t)})\ \log (1 - h_\Theta(x^{(t)}))$$  </p>
<p>Intuitively, $\delta_j^{(l)}$ is the “error” for $a^{(l)}_j$ (unit j in layer l). More formally, the delta values are actually the derivative of the cost function:  </p>
<p>$$\delta_j^{(l)} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z_j^{(l)}} cost(t)$$ </p>
<p>Recall that our derivative is the slope of a line tangent to the cost function, so the steeper the slope the more incorrect we are. Let us consider the following neural network below and see how we could calculate some $\delta_j^{(l)}$: </p>
<p> <img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/09/4.png" alt="backward propagation intuition1"></p>
<p>In the image above, to calculate $\delta_2^{(2)}$, we multiply the weights $\Theta_{12}^{(2)}$ and $\Theta_{22}^{(2)}$ by their respective $\delta$ values found to the right of each edge. So we get $\delta_2^{(2)}$= $\Theta_{12}^{(2)}$<em>$\delta_1^{(3)}$+$\Theta_{22}^{(2)}$</em>$\delta_2^{(3)}$. To calculate every single possible $\delta_j^{(l)}$, we could start from the right of our diagram. We can think of our edges as our $\Theta_{ij}$. Going from right to left, to calculate the value of $\delta_j^{(l)}$, you can just take the over all sum of each weight times the $\delta$ it is coming from. Hence, another example would be $\delta_2^{(3)}$=$\Theta_{12}^{(3)}$*$\delta_1^{(4)}$.</p>
<h1 id="02-backpropagation-in-practice"><a href="#02-backpropagation-in-practice" class="headerlink" title="02_backpropagation-in-practice"></a>02_backpropagation-in-practice</h1><h2 id="Implementation-Note-Unrolling-Parameters"><a href="#Implementation-Note-Unrolling-Parameters" class="headerlink" title="Implementation Note: Unrolling Parameters"></a>Implementation Note: Unrolling Parameters</h2><p>With neural networks, we are working with sets of matrices: </p>
<p> $$\begin{align*} \Theta^{(1)}, \Theta^{(2)}, \Theta^{(3)}, \dots \newline D^{(1)}, D^{(2)}, D^{(3)}, \dots \end{align*}$$</p>
<p>In order to use optimizing functions such as “fminunc()”, we will want to “unroll” all the elements and put them into one long vector: </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">thetaVector &#x3D; [ Theta1(:); Theta2(:); Theta3(:); ]</span><br><span class="line">deltaVector &#x3D; [ D1(:); D2(:); D3(:) ]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If the dimensions of Theta1 is 10x11, Theta2 is 10x11 and Theta3 is 1x11, then we can get back our original matrices from the “unrolled” versions as follows: </p>

<p>To summarize:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/09/5.png" alt="neural_network_learning_theta"></p>
<h2 id="Gradient-Checking"><a href="#Gradient-Checking" class="headerlink" title="Gradient Checking"></a>Gradient Checking</h2><p>Gradient checking will assure that our backpropagation works as intended. We can approximate the derivative of our cost function with:<br>$$<br>\dfrac{\partial}{\partial\Theta}J(\Theta) \approx \dfrac{J(\Theta + \epsilon) - J(\Theta - \epsilon)}{2\epsilon}<br>$$<br>With multiple theta matrices, we can approximate the derivative with respect to  $Θ_j$ as follows:<br>$$<br>\dfrac{\partial}{\partial\Theta_j}J(\Theta) \approx \dfrac{J(\Theta_1, \dots, \Theta_j + \epsilon, \dots, \Theta_n) - J(\Theta_1, \dots, \Theta_j - \epsilon, \dots, \Theta_n)}{2\epsilon}<br>$$<br>A small value for ϵ (epsilon) such as $ϵ=10^{−4}$ , guarantees that the math works out properly. If the value for ϵ is too small, we can end up with numerical problems. </p>
<p>Hence, we are only adding or subtracting epsilon to the $Θ_j$ matrix. In octave we can do it as follows:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">epsilon &#x3D; 1e-4;</span><br><span class="line">for i &#x3D; 1:n,</span><br><span class="line">  thetaPlus &#x3D; theta;</span><br><span class="line">  thetaPlus(i) +&#x3D; epsilon;</span><br><span class="line">  thetaMinus &#x3D; theta;</span><br><span class="line">  thetaMinus(i) -&#x3D; epsilon;</span><br><span class="line">  gradApprox(i) &#x3D; (J(thetaPlus) - J(thetaMinus))&#x2F;(2*epsilon)</span><br><span class="line">end;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>We previously saw how to calculate the deltaVector. So once we compute our gradApprox vector, we can check that gradApprox ≈ deltaVector. </p>
<p>Once you have verified once that your backpropagation algorithm is correct, you don’t need to compute gradApprox again. The code to compute gradApprox can be very slow.</p>
<h2 id="Random-Initialization"><a href="#Random-Initialization" class="headerlink" title="Random Initialization"></a>Random Initialization</h2><p>Initializing all theta weights to zero does not work with neural networks. When we backpropagate, all nodes will update to the same value repeatedly. Instead we can randomly initialize our weights for our ΘΘ matrices using the following method:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/09/6.png" alt="random_initialization_on_nn"></p>
<p>Hence, we initialize each $Θ^{(l)}_{ij}$ to a random value between $[−ϵ,ϵ]$ .  Using the above formula guarantees that we get the desired bound. The same procedure applies to all the $Θ’s$. Below is some working code you could use to experiment.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">If the dimensions of Theta1 is 10x11, Theta2 is 10x11 and Theta3 is 1x11.</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Theta1 &#x3D; rand(10,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON;</span><br><span class="line">Theta2 &#x3D; rand(10,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON;</span><br><span class="line">Theta3 &#x3D; rand(1,11) * (2 * INIT_EPSILON) - INIT_EPSILON;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>rand(x,y) is just a function in octave that will initialize a matrix of random real numbers between 0 and 1. </p>
<p>(Note: the epsilon used above is unrelated to the epsilon from Gradient Checking)</p>
<h2 id="Putting-it-Together"><a href="#Putting-it-Together" class="headerlink" title="Putting it Together"></a>Putting it Together</h2><p>First, pick a network architecture; choose the layout of your neural network, including how many hidden units in each layer and how many layers in total you want to have. </p>
<ul>
<li>Number of input units = dimension of features $x^{(i)}$</li>
<li>Number of output units = number of classes   </li>
<li>Number of hidden units per layer = usually more the better (must balance with cost of computation as it increases with more hidden units)   </li>
<li>Defaults: 1 hidden layer. If you have more than 1 hidden layer, then it is recommended that you have the same number of units in every hidden layer.   </li>
</ul>

<p>The following image gives us an intuition of what is happening as we are implementing our neural network:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/09/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ideally, you want $h_Θ(x^{(i)}) ≈ y(i)$ . This will minimize our cost function. However, keep in mind that $J(Θ)$ is not convex and thus we can end up in a local minimum instead.</p>

          <h1 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h1><p>This personal note is written after studying the opening course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the coursera website</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning by Andrew NG</a> . And images, audios of this note all comes from the opening course. </p>
<h2 id="Motivations"><a href="#Motivations" class="headerlink" title="Motivations"></a>Motivations</h2><h3 id="non-linear-hypotheses"><a href="#non-linear-hypotheses" class="headerlink" title="non-linear-hypotheses"></a>non-linear-hypotheses</h3><p>In order to motivate the discussion of neural networks, let me start by showing you a few examples of machine learning problems  where we need to learn complex non-linear hypotheses. Consider a supervised learning classification problem where you have a training set like this. If you want to apply logistic regression to this problem, one thing you could do is apply logistic regression with a lot of nonlinear features like that. So here, g as usual is the sigmoid function, and we can include lots of polynomial terms like these.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And, if you include enough polynomial terms then,  you know, maybe you can get a hypotheses that separates the positive and negative examples.This particular method works well when you have only, say,  two features - x1 and x2 because you can then include all those polynomial terms of x1 and x2. </p>
<h4 id="House-Prediction"><a href="#House-Prediction" class="headerlink" title="House Prediction"></a>House Prediction</h4><p>But for many interesting machine learning problems would have a lot more features than just two. We’ve been talking for a while about housing prediction, and suppose you have a housing classification problem rather than a regression problem, like maybe if you have different features of a house, and you want<br>to predict what are the odds that your house will be sold within the next six months, so that will be a classification problem. And as we saw we can come up with quite a lot of features, maybe a hundred different features of different houses. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For a problem like this, if you were to include all the quadratic terms, all of these, even all of the quadratic that is the second or the polynomial terms, there would be a lot of them. There would be terms like x1 squared, x1x2, x1x3, you know, x1x4 up to x1x100 and then you have x2 squared, x2x3 and so on. And if you include just the second order terms, that is, the terms that are a product of, you know,  two of these terms, x1 times x1 and so on, then, for the case of n equals 100, you end up with about five thousand features. And, asymptotically, the number of quadratic features grows roughly as order n squared, where n is the number of the original features, like x1 through x100 that we had. And its actually closer to n squared over two.  So including all the quadratic features doesn’t seem like it’s maybe a good idea, because that is a lot of features and you might up overfitting the training set, and it can also be computationally expensive, you know, to be working with that many features. One thing you could do is include only a subset of these, so if you include only the features x1 squared, x2 squared, x3 squared, up to maybe x100 squared, then the number of features is much smaller. Here you have only 100 such  quadratic features, but this is not enough features and certainly won’t let you fit the data set like that on the upper left. In fact, if you include only these quadratic features together with the original x1, and so on, up to x100 features, then you can actually fit very interesting hypotheses. So, you can fit things like, you know, access a line of the ellipses like these, but you certainly cannot fit a more complex data set like that shown here. So 5000 features seems like a lot, if you were to  include the cubic, or third order known of each others, the x1, x2, x3. You know, x1 squared, x2, x10 and x11, x17 and so on. You can imagine there are gonna be a lot of these features.</p>
<p>In fact, they are going to be order and cube such features and if any is 100 you can compute that, you end up with on the order of about 170,000 such cubic features and so including these higher auto-polynomial features when your original feature set end is large this really dramatically blows up your feature space and this doesn’t seem like a good way to come up with additional features with which to build none many classifiers when n is large. </p>
<h4 id="Car-recognition"><a href="#Car-recognition" class="headerlink" title="Car recognition"></a>Car recognition</h4><p><strong>For many machine learning problems, n will be pretty large</strong>.  Here’s an example. Let’s consider the problem of computer vision. And suppose you want to use machine learning to train a classifier to examine an image and tell us whether or not the image is a car. Many people wonder why computer vision could be difficult. I mean when you and I look at this picture it is so obvious what this is. You wonder how is it that a learning algorithm could possibly fail to know what this picture is.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To understand why computer vision is hard let’s zoom into a small part of the image like that area where the little red rectangle is. It turns out that where you and I see a car, the computer sees that. What it sees is this matrix, or this grid, of pixel intensity values that tells us the brightness of each pixel in the image.So the computer vision problem is to look at this matrix of pixel intensity values, and tell us that these numbers represent the door handle of a car. Concretely, when we use machine learning to build a car detector, what we do is we come up with a label training set, with, let’s say, a few label examples of cars and a few label examples of things that are not cars, then we give our training set to the learning algorithm trained a classifier and then, you know, we may test it and show the new image and ask, “What is this new thing?”. And hopefully it will recognize that that is a car.</p>
<p>To understand why we need nonlinear hypotheses, let’s take a look at some of the images of cars and maybe non-cars that we might feed to our learning algorithm. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s pick a couple of pixel locations in our images, so that’s pixel one location and pixel two location, and let’s plot this car, you know, at the location, at a certain point, depending on the intensities of pixel one and pixel two. And let’s do this with a few other images. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So let’s take a different example of  the car and you know, look at the same two pixel locations and that image has a different intensity for pixel one and a different intensity for pixel two. So, it ends up at a different location on the figure. And then let’s plot some negative examples as well. That’s a non-car, that’s a non-car. And if we do this for more and more examples using the pluses(+) to denote cars and minuses(-) to denote non-cars, what we’ll find is that the cars and non-cars end up lying in different regions of the space, and what we need therefore is some sort of non-linear hypotheses to try to separate out the two classes. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What is the dimension of the feature space? Suppose we were to use just 50 by 50 pixel images. Now that suppose our images were pretty small ones, just 50 pixels on the side. Then we would have 2500 pixels, and so the dimension of our feature size will be N equals 2500 where our feature vector x is a list of all the pixel testings, you know,  the pixel brightness of pixel one, the brightness of pixel two, and so on down to the pixel brightness of the last pixel where, you know, in a typical  computer representation, each of these may be values between say 0 to 255 if it gives us the grayscale value. So we have n equals 2500, and that’s if we were using grayscale images. If we were using RGB images with separate red, green and blue values, we would have n equals 7500. So, if we were to try to learn a nonlinear hypothesis by including all the quadratic features, that is all the terms of the form, you know, $X_i$ times $X_j$, while with the 2500 pixels we would end up with a total of three million features. And that’s just too large to be reasonable; the computation would be very expensive to find and to represent all of these three million features per training example. </p>
<p>*<em>So, simple logistic regression together with adding in maybe the quadratic or the cubic features that’s just not a good way to learn complex nonlinear hypotheses when n is large because you just end up with too many features. *</em></p>
<p>In the next few videos, I would like to tell you about <strong>Neural Networks, which turns out to be a much better way to learn complex hypotheses, complex nonlinear hypotheses even when your input feature space, even when n is large.</strong> And along the way I’ll also get to show you a couple of fun videos of historically important applications of Neural networks as well that I hope those videos that we’ll see later will be fun for you to watch as well.</p>
<h3 id="neurons-and-the-brain"><a href="#neurons-and-the-brain" class="headerlink" title="neurons and the brain"></a>neurons and the brain</h3><p>Neural Networks are a pretty old algorithm that was originally motivated by the goal of having machines that can mimic the brain. </p>
<p>Now in this class, of course I’m teaching Neural Networks to you because they work really well for different machine learning problems and not, certainly not because they’re logically motivated. In this video, I’d like to give you some of the background on Neural Networks. So that we can get a sense of what we can expect them to do. Both in the sense of applying them to modern day machinery problems, as well as for those of you that might be interested in maybe the big AI dream of someday building truly intelligent machines. Also, how Neural Networks might pertain to that. <strong>The origins of Neural Networks was as algorithms that try to mimic the brain</strong> and those a sense that if we want to build learning systems while why not mimic perhaps the most amazing learning machine we know about, which is perhaps the brain. </p>
<p>Neural Networks came to be very widely used throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s and for various reasons as popularity diminished in the late 90’s. But more recently, Neural Networks  have had a major recent resurgence. One of the reasons for this resurgence is that Neural Networks are computationally some what more expensive algorithm and so, it was only, you know, maybe somewhat more recently that computers became fast enough to really run large scale Neural Networks and because of that as well as a few other technical reasons which we’ll talk about later, modern Neural Networks today are the state of the art technique for many applications.</p>
<p>So, when you think about mimicking the brain while one of the human brain does tell me same things, right? The brain can learn to see process images than to hear, learn to process our sense of touch. We can, you know, learn to do math, learn to do calculus, and the brain does so many different and amazing things. It seems like if you want to mimic the brain it seems like you have to write lots of different pieces of software to mimic all of these different fascinating, amazing things that the brain tell us, but does is this fascinating hypothesis that the way the brain does all of these different things is not worth like a thousand different programs, but instead, the way the brain does it is worth just a single learning algorithm. This is just a hypothesis but let me share with you some of the evidence for this.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This part of the brain, that little red part of the brain, is your auditory cortex and the way you’re understanding my voice now is your ear is taking the sound signal and routing the sound signal to your auditory cortex and that’s what’s allowing you to understand my words. Neuroscientists have done the following fascinating experiments where you cut the wire from the ears to the auditory cortex and you re-wire, in this case an animal’s brain, so that the signal from the eyes to the optic nerve eventually gets routed to the auditory cortex. If you do this it turns out, the auditory cortex will learn to see. And this is in every single sense of the word see as we know it. So, if you do this to the animals, the animals can perform visual discrimination task and as they can look at images and make appropriate decisions based on the images and they’re doing it with that piece of brain tissue. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here’s another example. That red piece of brain tissue is your somatosensory cortex. That’s how you process your sense of touch. If you do a similar re-wiring process then the somatosensory cortex will learn to see. Because of this and other similar experiments, these are called neuro-rewiring experiments. There’s this sense that if the same piece of physical brain tissue can process sight or sound or touch then maybe there is one learning algorithm that can process sight or sound or touch. And instead of needing to implement a thousand different programs or a thousand different algorithms to do, you know, the thousand wonderful things that the brain does, maybe what we need to do is figure out some approximation or to whatever the brain’s learning algorithm is and implement that and that the brain learned by itself how to process these different types of data. To a surprisingly large extent, it seems as if we can plug in almost any sensor to almost any part of the brain and so, within the reason, the brain will learn to deal with it.</p>
<h4 id="Sensor-representations-in-the-brain"><a href="#Sensor-representations-in-the-brain" class="headerlink" title="Sensor representations in the brain"></a>Sensor representations in the brain</h4><p>Here are a few more examples. On the upper left is an example of learning to see with your tongue. The way it works is–this is actually a system called BrainPort undergoing FDA trials now to help blind people see–but the way it works is, you strap a grayscale camera to your forehead, facing forward, that takes the low resolution grayscale image of what’s in front of you and you then run a wire to an array of electrodes that you place on your tongue so that each pixel gets mapped to a location on your tongue where maybe a high voltage corresponds to a dark pixel and a low voltage corresponds to a bright pixel and, even as it does today, with this sort of system you and I will be able to learn to see, you know, in tens of minutes with our tongues.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here’s a second example of human echo location or human sonar. So there are two ways you can do this. You can either snap your fingers, or click your tongue. I can’t do that very well. But there are blind people today that are actually being trained in schools to do this and learn to interpret the pattern of sounds bouncing off your environment - that’s sonar. So, if after you search on YouTube, there are actually videos of this amazing kid who tragically because of cancer had his eyeballs removed, so this is a kid with no eyeballs. But by snapping his fingers, he can walk around and never hit anything. He can ride a skateboard. He can shoot a basketball into a hoop and this is a kid with no eyeballs.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Third example is the Haptic Belt where if you have a strap around your waist, ring up buzzers and always have the northmost one buzzing. You can give a human a direction sense similar to maybe how birds can, you know, sense where north is.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And, some of the bizarre example, but if you plug a third eye into a frog, the frog will learn to use that eye as well. </p>

<p><strong>So, it’s pretty amazing to what extent is as if you can plug in almost any sensor to the brain and the brain’s learning algorithm will just figure out how to learn from that data and deal with that data. And there’s a sense that if we can figure out what the brain’s learning algorithm is, and, you know, implement it or implement some approximation to that algorithm on a computer, maybe that would be our best shot at, you know, making real progress towards the AI, the artificial intelligence dream of someday building truly intelligent machines.</strong> Now, of course, I’m not teaching Neural Networks, you know, just because they might give us a window into this far-off AI dream, even though I’m personally, that’s one of the things that I personally work on in my research life. But the main reason I’m teaching Neural Networks in this class is because it’s actually a very effective state of the art technique for modern day machine learning applications. So, in the next few videos, we’ll start diving into the technical details of Neural Networks so that you can apply them to modern-day machine learning applications and get them to work well on problems. But for me, you know, one of the reasons the excite me  is that maybe they give us this window into what we might do if we’re also thinking of what algorithms might someday be able to learn in a manner similar to humankind.</p>
<h2 id="neural-networks"><a href="#neural-networks" class="headerlink" title="neural-networks"></a>neural-networks</h2><h3 id="Model-Representation-I"><a href="#Model-Representation-I" class="headerlink" title="Model Representation I"></a>Model Representation I</h3><p>Let’s examine how we will represent a hypothesis function using neural networks. At a very simple level, neurons are basically computational units that take inputs (<strong>dendrites</strong>) as electrical inputs (called “spikes”) that are channeled to outputs (<strong>axons</strong>).</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/13.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In our model, our dendrites are like the input features $x_1⋯x_n​$, and the output is the result of our hypothesis function. In this model our $x_0​$ input node is sometimes called the “<strong>bias unit</strong>“. It is always equal to 1. In neural networks, we use the same logistic function as in classification,  $\frac{1}{1+e^{−θ^Tx}}​$, yet we sometimes call it a sigmoid (logistic) <strong>activation</strong> function. In this situation, our “theta” parameters are sometimes called “weights”.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/15.png" alt="Neuron-model_Logistic-unit"></p>
<p>Visually, a simplistic representation looks like:<br>$$<br>\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \newline x_1 \ x_2 \ \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}\ \ \ \ \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow h_\theta(x)<br>$$<br>Our input nodes (layer 1), also known as the “<strong>input layer</strong>“, go into another node (layer 2), which finally outputs the hypothesis function, known as the “<strong>output layer</strong>“. We can have intermediate layers of nodes between the input and output layers called the “<strong>hidden layers</strong>“. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/16.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example, we label these intermediate or *”hidden” layer* nodes $a^{(2)}_0 ⋯ a^{(2)}_n$ and call them “<strong>activation units</strong>“.<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& a_i^{(j)} = \text{"activation" of unit $i$ in layer $j$} \\ & \Theta^{(j)} = \text{matrix of weights controlling function mapping from layer $j$ to layer $j+1$}\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>If we had one hidden layer, it would look like:<br>$$<br>\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \ x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \ a_2^{(2)} \ a_3^{(2)} \ \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow h_\theta(x)<br>$$<br>The values for each of the “activation” nodes is obtained as follows:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*} a_1^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_2^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{20}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{21}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{22}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{23}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_3^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{30}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{31}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{32}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{33}^{(1)}x_3) \\ h_\Theta(x) = a_1^{(3)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)}) \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>This is saying that we compute our activation nodes by using a $3×4​$ matrix of parameters. We apply each row of the parameters to our inputs to obtain the value for one activation node. Our hypothesis output is the logistic function applied to the sum of the values of our activation nodes, which have been multiplied by yet another parameter matrix $Θ^{(2)}​$ containing the weights for our second layer of nodes. </p>
<p>Each layer gets its own matrix of weights, $Θ^{(j)}$. The dimensions of these matrices of weights is determined as follows: If network has $s_j$ units in layer j and $s_{j+1}$ units in layer j+1, then $Θ^{(j)}$ will be of dimension $s_{j+1}×(s_j+1)$.If network has $s_j$ units in layer $j$ and $s_{j+1}$ units in layer j+1, then $Θ^(j)$ will be of dimension $s_{j+1}×(s_j+1)$. <strong><em>The +1 comes from the addition in $Θ^{(j)}$ of the “bias nodes,” $x_0$ and $Θ^{(j)}_0$. In other words the output nodes will not include the bias nodes while the inputs will.</em></strong>  The following image summarizes our model representation:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/17.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Example: If layer 1 has 2 input nodes and layer 2 has 4 activation nodes. Dimension of $Θ^{(1)}$ is going to be $4×3$ where $s_j=2$ and $s_j+1=4$ so $s_{j+1}×(sj+1)=4×3$ .</p>
<h3 id="Model-Representation-II"><a href="#Model-Representation-II" class="headerlink" title="Model Representation II"></a>Model Representation II</h3><p>To re-iterate, the following is an example of a neural network:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*} a_1^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_2^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{20}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{21}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{22}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{23}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_3^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{30}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{31}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{32}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{33}^{(1)}x_3) \\ h_\Theta(x) = a_1^{(3)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)}) \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>In this section we’ll do a vectorized implementation of the above functions. We’re going to define a new variable $z^{(j)}_k$ that encompasses the parameters inside our g function. In our previous example if we replaced by the variable z for all the parameters we would get:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}a_1^{(2)} = g(z_1^{(2)}) \\ a_2^{(2)} = g(z_2^{(2)}) \\ a_3^{(2)} = g(z_3^{(2)}) \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>In other words, for layer j=2 and node k, the variable z will be:<br>$$<br>z_k^{(2)} = \Theta_{k,0}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{k,1}^{(1)}x_1 + \cdots + \Theta_{k,n}^{(1)}x_n<br>$$<br>The vector representation of $x$ and $z_j$ is :<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}x = \begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\\cdots \\ x_n\end{bmatrix},  z^{(j)} = \begin{bmatrix}z_1^{(j)} \\ z_2^{(j)} \\\cdots \\ z_n^{(j)}\end{bmatrix}\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>Setting $x=a^{(1)}$, we can rewrite the equation as:<br>$$<br>z^{(j)} = \Theta^{(j-1)}a^{(j-1)}<br>$$<br>We are multiplying our matrix $Θ^{(j−1)}$ with dimensions $s_j×(n+1)$ (where $s_j$ is the number of our activation nodes) by our vector $a^{(j−1)}$ with height $(n+1)$. This gives us our vector $z(j)$ with height $s_j$. Now we can get a vector of our activation nodes for layer $j$ as follows:<br>$$<br>a^{(j)} = g(z^{(j)})<br>$$<br>Where our function g can be applied element-wise to our vector $z^{(j)}$. </p>
<p>We can then add a bias unit (equal to 1) to layer j after we have computed $a^{(j)}$. This will be element $a^{(j)}_0$ and will be equal to 1. To compute our final hypothesis, let’s first compute another $z$ vector:<br>$$<br>z^{(j+1)} = \Theta^{(j)}a^{(j)}<br>$$<br>We get this final $z$ vector by multiplying the next theta matrix after $Θ^{(j−1)}$ with the values of all the activation nodes we just got. This last theta matrix $Θ^{(j)}$ will have only <strong>one row</strong> which is multiplied by one column $a^{(j)}$ so that our result is a single number. We then get our final result with:<br>$$<br>h_\Theta(x) = a^{(j+1)} = g(z^{(j+1)})<br>$$<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/18.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that in this <strong>last step</strong>, between layer j and layer j+1, we are doing <strong>exactly the same thing</strong> as we did in logistic regression. Adding all these intermediate layers in neural networks allows us to more elegantly produce interesting and more complex non-linear hypotheses.</p>
<h4 id="Neural-network-learning-its-own-features"><a href="#Neural-network-learning-its-own-features" class="headerlink" title="Neural network learning its own features"></a>Neural network learning its own features</h4><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/19.png" alt=""></p>
<p>let’s say I cover up the left path of this picture for now. If you look at what’s left in this picture. This looks a lot like logistic regression where what we’re doing is we’re using that note, that’s just the logistic regression unit and we’re using that to make a prediction h of x. And concretely, what the hypotheses is outputting is h of x is going to be equal to g which is my sigmoid activation function times theta 0 times a0 is equal to 1 plus theta 1 plus theta 2 times a2 plus theta 3 times a3 whether values a1, a2, a3 are those given by these three given units. Now, to be actually consistent to my early notation.</p>
<p>Actually, we need to, you know, fill in these superscript 2’s here everywhere and I also have these indices 1 there because I have only one output unit, but if you focus on the blue parts of the notation. This is, you know, this looks awfully like the standard logistic regression model, except that I now have a capital theta instead of lower case theta. And what this is doing is just logistic regression. But where the features fed into logistic regression are these values computed by the hidden layer. Just to say that again, what this neural network is doing is just like logistic regression, except that rather than using the original features x1, x2, x3, is using these new features a1, a2, a3. Again, we’ll put the superscripts there, you know, to be consistent with the notation. And the cool thing about this, is that the features a1, a2, a3, they themselves are learned as functions of the input. Concretely, the function mapping from layer 1 to layer 2, that is determined by some other set of parameters, theta 1. So it’s as if the neural network, instead of being constrained to feed the features x1, x2, x3 to logistic regression. It gets to learn its own features, a1, a2, a3, to feed into the logistic regression and as you can imagine depending on what parameters it chooses for theta 1.<br>You can learn some pretty interesting and complex features and therefore you can end up with a better hypotheses than if you were constrained to use the raw features x1, x2 or x3 or if you will constrain to say choose the polynomial terms, you know, x1, x2, x3, and so on. But instead, this algorithm has the flexibility to try to learn whatever features at once, using these a1, a2, a3 in order to feed into this last unit that’s essentially a logistic regression here.<br>I realized this example is described as a somewhat high level and so I’m not sure if this intuition of the neural network, you know, having more complex features will quite make sense yet, but if it doesn’t yet in the next two videos I’m going to go through a specific example of how a neural network can use this hidden there to compute more complex features to feed into this final output layer and how that can learn more complex hypotheses. So, in case what I’m saying here doesn’t quite make sense, stick with me for the next two videos and hopefully out there working through those examples this explanation will make a little bit more sense. But just the point O. </p>
<h4 id="Other-network-architectures"><a href="#Other-network-architectures" class="headerlink" title="Other network architectures"></a>Other network architectures</h4><p>You can have neural networks with other types of diagrams as well, and the way that neural networks are connected, that’s called the architecture. So the term architecture refers to how the different neurons are connected to each other. This is an example of a different neural network architecture and once again you may be able to get this intuition of how the second layer, here we have three heading units that are computing some complex function maybe of the input layer, and then the third layer can take the second layer’s features and compute even more complex features in layer three so that by the time you get to the output layer, layer four, you can have even more complex features of what you are able to compute in layer three and so get very interesting nonlinear hypotheses. By the way, in a network like this, layer one, this is called an input layer. Layer four is still our output layer, and this network has two hidden layers.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So anything that’s not an input layer or an output layer is called a hidden layer. So, hopefully from this video you’ve gotten a sense of how the feed forward propagation step in a neural network works where you start from the activations of the input layer and forward propagate that to the first hidden layer, then the second hidden layer, and then finally the output layer. And you also saw how we can vectorize that computation. In the next, I realized that some of the intuitions in this video of how, you know, other certain layers are computing complex features of the early layers. I realized some of that intuition may be still slightly abstract and kind of a high level. And so what I would like to do in the two videos is work through a detailed example of how a neural network can be used to compute nonlinear functions of the input and hope that will give you a good sense of the sorts of complex nonlinear hypotheses we can get out of Neural Networks.</p>
<h2 id="Applications"><a href="#Applications" class="headerlink" title="Applications"></a>Applications</h2><h3 id="Examples-and-Intuitions-I"><a href="#Examples-and-Intuitions-I" class="headerlink" title="Examples and Intuitions I"></a>Examples and Intuitions I</h3><p>A simple example of applying neural networks is by predicting x1 AND x2, which is the logical ‘and’ operator and is only true if both x1 and x2 are 1. </p>
<p>The graph of our functions will look like:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}g(z^{(2)})\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow h_\Theta(x)\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>Remember that x0 is our bias variable and is always 1. </p>
<p>Let’s set our first theta matrix as:<br>$$<br>\Theta^{(1)} =\begin{bmatrix}-30 &amp; 20 &amp; 20\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>This will cause the output of our hypothesis to only be positive if both x1 and x2 are 1. In other words:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& h_\Theta(x) = g(-30 + 20x_1 + 20x_2) \\ \\ & x_1 = 0 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 0 \ \ then \ \ g(-30) \approx 0 \\ & x_1 = 0 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 1 \ \ then \ \ g(-10) \approx 0 \\ & x_1 = 1 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 0 \ \ then \ \ g(-10) \approx 0 \\ & x_1 = 1 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 1 \ \ then \ \ g(10) \approx 1\end{align*}
<p>$$<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/21.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So we have constructed one of the fundamental operations in computers by using a small neural network rather than using an actual AND gate. </p>
<p>Neural networks can also be used to simulate all the other logical gates. The following is an example of the logical operator ‘OR’, meaning either x1 is true or x2 is true, or both:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/22.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Examples-and-Intuitions-II"><a href="#Examples-and-Intuitions-II" class="headerlink" title="Examples and Intuitions II"></a>Examples and Intuitions II</h3><p>The $Θ^{(1)}$ matrices for AND, NOR, and OR are :<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}AND:\\ \Theta^{(1)} &=\begin{bmatrix}-30 & 20 & 20\end{bmatrix} \\ NOR:\\ \Theta^{(1)} &= \begin{bmatrix}10 & -20 & -20\end{bmatrix} \\ OR:\\ \Theta^{(1)} &= \begin{bmatrix}-10 & 20 & 20\end{bmatrix} \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>We can combine these to get the XNOR logical operator (which gives 1 if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both 0 or both 1).<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \\ a_2^{(2)} \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}a^{(3)}\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow h_\Theta(x)\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>For the transition between the first and second layer, we’ll use a $Θ^{(1)}$ matrix that combines the values for AND and NOR:<br>$$<br>\Theta^{(1)} =\begin{bmatrix}-30 &amp; 20 &amp; 20 \ 10 &amp; -20 &amp; -20\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>For transition between the second and third layer, we’ll use a $Θ^{(2)}$ matrix that uses the value for OR:<br>$$<br>\Theta^{(2)} =\begin{bmatrix}-10 &amp; 20 &amp; 20\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>Let’s write out the values for all our nodes:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& a^{(2)} = g(\Theta^{(1)} \cdot x) \\ & a^{(3)} = g(\Theta^{(2)} \cdot a^{(2)}) \\ & h_\Theta(x) = a^{(3)}\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>And there we have the XNOR operator using a hidden layer with two nodes! The following summarizes the above algorithm:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/23.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Multiclass-Classification"><a href="#Multiclass-Classification" class="headerlink" title="Multiclass Classification"></a>Multiclass Classification</h3><p>To classify data into multiple classes, we let our hypothesis function return a vector of values. Say we wanted to classify our data into one of four categories. We will use the following example to see how this classification is done. This algorithm takes as input an image and classifies it accordingly:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/24.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can define our set of resulting classes as y:<br>$$<br>y^{(i)}=\begin{bmatrix}1\0\0\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\1\0\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\0\1\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\0\0\1\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>Each $y^{(i)}$ represents a different image corresponding to either a car, pedestrian, truck, or motorcycle. The inner layers, each provide us with some new information which leads to our final hypothesis function. The setup looks like:<br>$$<br>\begin{bmatrix}x_0\x_1\x_2\ \cdots \ x_n\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}a_0^{(2)}\a_1^{(2)}\ \cdots \ a_n^{(2)}\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}a_0^{(3)}\a_1^{(3)}\ \cdots \ a_n^{(3)}\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}h_\Theta(x)_1\h_\Theta(x)_2\h_\Theta(x)_3\h_\Theta(x)_4\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>Our resulting hypothesis for one set of inputs may look like:<br>$$<br>h_\Theta(x) =\begin{bmatrix}0 \ 0 \ 1 \ 0 \ \end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>In which case our resulting class is the third one down, or $h_Θ(x)_3$, which represents the motorcycle.</p>

          <h2 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h2><p>This personal note is written after studying the opening course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the coursera website</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning by Andrew NG</a> .

<h2 id="The-Problem-of-Overfitting"><a href="#The-Problem-of-Overfitting" class="headerlink" title="The Problem of Overfitting"></a>The Problem of Overfitting</h2><p>Consider the problem of predicting $y$ from $x ∈ R$. The leftmost figure below shows the result of fitting a $y = θ_0+θ_1x$ to a dataset. We see that the data doesn’t really lie on straight line, and so the fit is not very good.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/07/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead, if we had added an extra feature $x_2$ , and fit $y=θ<em>0+θ_1x+θ_2x^2$ , then we obtain a slightly better fit to the data (See middle figure). Naively, it might seem that the more features we add, the better. However, there is also a danger in adding too many features: The rightmost figure is the result of fitting a $5^{th}$ order polynomial $y=\sum</em>{j=0}^{5}\theta_jx^j$ . We see that even though the fitted curve passes through the data perfectly, we would not expect this to be a very good predictor of, say, housing prices (y) for different living areas(x). Without formally defining what these terms mean, we’ll say the figure on the left shows an instance of  <strong>underfitting</strong> —in which the data clearly shows structure not captured by the model—and the figure on the right is an example of *<em>overfitting *</em>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/07/2.png" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Underfitting, or high bias</strong>, <em>is when the form of our hypothesis function h maps poorly to the trend of the data. It is usually caused by a function that is too simple or uses too few features.</em></li>
<li>At the other extreme, <strong>overfitting, or high variance</strong>, <em>is caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but does not generalize well to predict new data. It is usually caused by a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves and angles unrelated to the data.</em> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This terminology is applied to both linear and logistic regression. There are two main options to address the issue of overfitting:</strong> </p>
<p>1) Reduce the number of features: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>​    Manually select which features to keep.   </p>
</li>
<li><p>​    Use a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course, such as PCA).   </p>
<p>2) Regularization </p>
</li>
<li><p>​    Keep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters $θ_j$.   </p>
</li>
<li><p>​    Regularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Cost-Function"><a href="#Cost-Function" class="headerlink" title="Cost Function"></a>Cost Function</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong>    [5:18 - There is a typo. It should be $\sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta <em>j ^2$ instead of $\sum</em>{i=1}^{n} \theta _j ^2$]</p>
<p>If we have overfitting from our hypothesis function, we can reduce the weight that some of the terms in our function carry by increasing their cost. </p>
<p>Say we wanted to make the following function more quadratic:<br>$$<br>\theta_0 + \theta_1x + \theta_2x^2 + \theta_3x^3 + \theta_4x^4<br>$$<br>We’ll want to eliminate the influence of $θ_3x_3$ and $θ_4x_4$ . Without actually getting rid of these features or changing the form of our hypothesis, we can instead modify our</p>
<p><strong>cost function</strong> :<br>$$<br>min_\theta\ \dfrac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 + 1000\cdot\theta_3^2 + 1000\cdot\theta_4^2<br>$$<br>We’ve added two extra terms at the end to inflate the cost of $θ_3$ and $θ_4$. Now, in order for the cost function to get close to zero, we will have to reduce the values of $θ_3$ and $θ_4$ to near zero. This will in turn greatly reduce the values of $θ_3x_3$ and $θ_4x_4$ in our hypothesis function. As a result, we see that the new hypothesis (depicted by the pink curve) looks like a quadratic function but fits the data better due to the extra small terms $θ_3x_3$ and $θ_4x_4$.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/07/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We could also regularize all of our theta parameters in a single summation as:<br>$$<br>min_\theta\ \dfrac{1}{2m}\  \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 + \lambda\ \sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2<br>$$<br>The λ, or lambda, is the  <strong>regularization parameter</strong> . It determines how much the costs of our theta parameters are inflated. </p>
<p>Using the above cost function with the extra summation, we can smooth the output of our hypothesis function to reduce overfitting. If lambda is chosen to be too large, it may smooth out the function too much and cause underfitting. Hence, what would happen if λ=0 or is too small ?</p>

<h2 id="Regularized-Linear-Regression"><a href="#Regularized-Linear-Regression" class="headerlink" title="Regularized Linear Regression"></a>Regularized Linear Regression</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong>    [8:43 - It is said that X is non-invertible if m ≤ n. The correct statement should be that X is non-invertible if m &lt; n, and may be non-invertible if m = n. </p>
<p>We can apply regularization to both linear regression and logistic regression. We will approach linear regression first.<br>$$<br>J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2m} \left[  \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}\left(h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)}\right)^2 + \lambda\sum_{j=1}^{n}\theta_j^2 \right]<br>$$</p>
<h3 id="Gradient-Descent"><a href="#Gradient-Descent" class="headerlink" title="Gradient Descent"></a>Gradient Descent</h3><p>We will modify our gradient descent function to separate out θ0θ0 from the rest of the parameters because we do not want to penalize<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*} & \text{Repeat}\ \lbrace \\ & \ \ \ \ \theta_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha\ \frac{1}{m}\ \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_0^{(i)} \\ & \ \ \ \ \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha\ \left[ \left( \frac{1}{m}\ \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} \right) + \frac{\lambda}{m}\theta_j \right] &\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ j \in \lbrace 1,2...n\rbrace\\ & \rbrace \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>The term $\frac{λ}{m} θ<em>j$ performs our regularization. With some manipulation our update rule can also be represented as:<br>$$<br>\theta_j := \theta_j(1 - \alpha\frac{\lambda}{m}) - \alpha\frac{1}{m}\sum</em>{i=1}^m(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)}<br>$$<br>The first term in the above equation, $1−α\frac{λ}{m}$ will always be less than 1. Intuitively you can see it as reducing the value of $θ_j$ by some amount on every update. Notice that the second term is now exactly the same as it was before.</p>
<h3 id="Normal-Equation"><a href="#Normal-Equation" class="headerlink" title="Normal Equation"></a>Normal Equation</h3><p>Now let’s approach regularization using the alternate method of the non-iterative normal equation. </p>
<p>To add in regularization, the equation is the same as our original, except that we add another term inside the parentheses:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& \theta = \left( X^TX + \lambda \cdot L \right)^{-1} X^Ty \\ & \text{where}\ \ L = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & & & & \\ & 1 & & & \\ & & 1 & & \\ & & & \ddots & \\ & & & & 1 \\\end{bmatrix}\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>L is a matrix with 0 at the top left and 1’s down the diagonal, with 0’s everywhere else. It should have dimension (n+1)×(n+1). Intuitively, this is the identity matrix (though we are not including $x_0$), multiplied with a single real number λ. </p>
<p>Recall that <strong>if m &lt; n, then $X^TX$ is non-invertible. However, when we add the term λ⋅L, then $X^TX + λ⋅L$ becomes invertible.(Note: which is proved)</strong></p>
<h2 id="Regularized-Logistic-Regression"><a href="#Regularized-Logistic-Regression" class="headerlink" title="Regularized Logistic Regression"></a>Regularized Logistic Regression</h2><p>We can regularize logistic regression in a similar way that we regularize linear regression. As a result, we can avoid overfitting. The following image shows how the regularized function, displayed by the pink line, is less likely to overfit than the non-regularized function represented by the blue line:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/07/5.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Cost-Function-1"><a href="#Cost-Function-1" class="headerlink" title="Cost Function"></a>Cost Function</h3><p>Recall that our cost function for logistic regression was:<br>$$<br>J(\theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \large[ y^{(i)}\ \log (h_\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\ \log (1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)})) \large]<br>$$<br>We can regularize this equation by adding a term to the end:<br>$$<br>J(\theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \large[ y^{(i)}\ \log (h_\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\ \log (1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))\large] + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2<br>$$<br>The second sum, $∑_n^{j=1}θ^2_j$ <strong>means to explicitly exclude</strong> the bias term, $θ_0$. I.e. the θ vector is indexed from 0 to n (holding n+1 values, $θ_0$ through $θ_n$), and this sum explicitly skips $θ_0$, by running from 1 to n, skipping 0. Thus, when computing the equation, we should continuously update the two following equations:</p>

<h3 id="Advanced-optimization"><a href="#Advanced-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Advanced optimization"></a>Advanced optimization</h3><p>Let’s talk about how to get regularized linear regression to work using the more advanced optimization methods. And just to remind you for those methods what we needed to do was to define the function that’s called the cost function, that takes us input the parameter vector theta and once again in the equations we’ve been writing here we used 0 index vectors. So we had theta 0 up to theta N. But because Octave indexes the vectors starting from 1. Theta 0 is written in Octave as theta 1. Theta 1 is written in Octave as theta 2, and so on down to theta N plus 1. And what we needed to do was provide a function. Let’s provide a function called cost function that we would then pass in to what we have, what we saw earlier. We will use the <code>fminunc</code> and then you know at cost function, and so on, right. But the <code>fminunc</code> was function minimization unconstrained in Octave and this will work with <code>fminunc</code> was what will take the cost function and minimize it for us. So the two main things that the cost function needed to return were first J-val. And for that, we need to write code to compute the <code>costfunction</code> J of theta. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/07/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, when we’re using regularized logistic regression, of course the <code>costfunction</code> J of theta changes and, in particular, now a cost function needs to include this additional regularization term at the end as well. So, when you compute j of theta be sure to include that term at the end. </p>
<p>And then, the other thing that this cost function thing needs to derive with a gradient. So gradient one needs to be set to the partial derivative of J of theta with respect to theta zero, gradient two needs to be set to that, and so on. Once again, the index is off by one. Right, because of the indexing from one Octave users. And looking at these terms. This term over here. We actually worked this out on a previous slide is actually equal to this. It doesn’t change. Because the derivative for theta zero doesn’t change. Compared to the version without regularization. And the other terms do change. And in particular the derivative respect to theta one. We worked this out on the previous slide as well. Is equal to, you know, the original term and then minus londer M times theta 1. Just so we make sure we pass this correctly. And we can add parentheses here. Right, so the summation doesn’t extend. And similarly, you know, this other term here looks like this, with this additional term that we had on the previous slide, that corresponds to the gradient from their regularization objective. So if you implement this cost function and pass this into <code>fminunc</code> or to one of those advanced optimization techniques, that will minimize the new regularized cost function J of theta. And the parameters you get out will be the ones that correspond to logistic regression with regularization. </p>
<p>So, now you know how to implement regularized logistic regression. When I walk around Silicon Valley, I live here in Silicon Valley, there are a lot of engineers that are frankly, making a ton of money for their companies using machine learning algorithms. And I know we’ve only been, you know, studying this stuff for a little while. But if you understand linear regression, the advanced optimization algorithms and regularization, by now, frankly, you probably know quite a lot more machine learning than many, certainly now, but you probably know quite a lot more machine learning right now than frankly, many of the Silicon Valley engineers out there having very successful careers. You know, making tons of money for the companies. Or building products using machine learning algorithms. So, congratulations. You’ve actually come a long ways. And you can actually, you actually know enough to apply this stuff and get to work for many problems. So congratulations for that. But of course, there’s still a lot more that we want to teach you, and in the next set of videos after this, we’ll start to talk about a very powerful cause of non-linear classifier. So whereas linear regression, logistic regression, you know, you can form polynomial terms, but it turns out that there are much more powerful nonlinear quantifiers that can then sort of polynomial regression. And in the next set of videos after this one, I’ll start telling you about them. So that you have even more powerful learning algorithms than you have now to apply to different problems.</p>
