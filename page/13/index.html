          <p>In the next few videos I’d like to talk about <strong>machine learning system design</strong>. These videos will touch on <strong>the main issues that you may face when designing a complex machine learning system, and will actually try to give advice on how to strategize putting together a complex machine learning system.</strong></p><p>In case this next set of videos seems a little disjointed that’s because these videos will touch on a range of the different issues that you may come across when designing complex learning systems. And <strong><em>even though the next set of videos may seem somewhat less mathematical, I think that this material may turn out to be very useful, and potentially huge time savers when you’re building big machine learning systems.</em></strong></p><h1 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h1><p>This personal note is written after studying the opening course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the coursera website</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning by Andrew NG</a> . And images, audios of this note all comes from the opening course.</p><h1 id="01-building-a-spam-classifier"><a href="#01-building-a-spam-classifier" class="headerlink" title="01_building-a-spam-classifier"></a>01_building-a-spam-classifier</h1><h2 id="Prioritizing-What-to-Work-On"><a href="#Prioritizing-What-to-Work-On" class="headerlink" title="Prioritizing What to Work On"></a>Prioritizing What to Work On</h2><p>Concretely, I’d like to begin with the issue of prioritizing how to spend your time on what to work on, and I’ll begin with an example on spam classification.</p><p>Let’s say you want to build <strong>a spam classifier</strong>. Here are a couple of examples of obvious spam and non-spam emails. if the one on the left tried to sell things. And notice how spammers will deliberately misspell words, like Vincent with a 1 there, and mortgages. And on the right as maybe an obvious example of non-stamp email, actually email from my younger brother. Let’s say we have a labeled training set of some number of spam emails and some non-spam emails denoted with labels y equals 1 or 0, how do we build a classifier using supervised learning to distinguish between spam and non-spam?</p><p><strong>In order to apply supervised learning, the first decision we must make is how do we want to represent x, that is the features of the email.</strong> Given the features x and the labels y in our training set, we can then train a classifier, for example using logistic regression. Here’s one way to choose a set of features for our emails. We could come up with, say, a list of maybe a hundred words that we think are indicative of whether e-mail is spam or non-spam, for example, if a piece of e-mail contains the word ‘deal’ maybe it’s more likely to be spam if it contains the word ‘buy’ maybe more likely to be spam, a word like ‘discount’ is more likely to be spam, whereas if a piece of email contains my name, Andrew, maybe that means the person actually knows who I am and that might mean it’s less likely to be spam. And maybe for some reason I think the word “now” may be indicative of non-spam because I get a lot of urgent emails, and so on, and maybe we choose a hundred words or so. <strong>Given a piece of email, we can then take this piece of email and encode it into a feature vector as follows.</strong> I’m going to take my list of a hundred words and sort them in alphabetical order say. It doesn’t have to be sorted. But, you know, here’s a, here’s my list of words, just count and so on, until eventually I’ll get down to now, and so on and given a piece of e-mail like that shown on the right, I’m going to check and see whether or not each of these words appears in the e-mail and then I’m going to define a feature vector x where in this piece of an email on the right, my name doesn’t appear so I’m gonna put a zero there. The word “by” does appear, so I’m gonna put a one there and I’m just gonna put one’s or zeroes. I’m gonna put a one even though the word “by” occurs twice. I’m not gonna recount how many times the word occurs. The word “due” appears, I put a one there. The word “discount” doesn’t appear, at least not in this this little short email, and so on. The word “now” does appear and so on. <strong>So I put ones and zeroes in this feature vector depending on whether or not a particular word appears.</strong></p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/1.png" alt="example_of_spam-email_and_non-spam-email"></p><p><strong>And in this example my feature vector would have to mention one hundred, if I have a hundred, if if I chose a hundred words to use for this representation and each of my features $X_j$ will basically be $1$ if you have a particular word that, we’ll call this word j, appears in the email and $X_j$ would be $0$ otherwise.</strong></p><p>Okay. So that gives me a feature representation of a piece of email. By the way, even though I’ve described this process as manually picking a hundred words, in practice what’s most commonly done is to look through a training set, and in the training set depict the most frequently occurring n words where n is usually between ten thousand and fifty thousand, and use those as your features. So rather than manually picking a hundred words, here you look through the training examples and pick the most frequently occurring words like ten thousand to fifty thousand words, and those form the features that you are going to use to represent your email for spam classification.</p><p><strong>Now, if you’re building a spam classifier, one question that you may face is, what’s the best use of your time in order to make your spam classifier have higher accuracy, you have lower error.</strong> One natural inclination is going to collect lots of data. Right? And in fact there’s this tendency to think that, well the more data we have the better the algorithm will do. And in fact, in the email spam domain, there are actually pretty serious projects called Honey Pot Projects, which create fake email addresses and try to get these fake email addresses into the hands of spammers and use that to try to collect tons of spam email, and therefore you know, get a lot of spam data to train learning algorithms. But we’ve already seen in the previous sets of videos that getting lots of data will often help, but not all the time. But for most machine learning problems, there are a lot of other things you could usually imagine doing to improve performance. For spam, one thing you might think of is to develop more sophisticated features on the email, maybe based on the email routing information. And this would be information contained in the email header. So, when spammers send email, very often they will try to obscure the origins of the email, and maybe use fake email headers. Or send email through very unusual sets of computer service. Through very unusual routes, in order to get the spam to you. And some of this information will be reflected in the email header. And so one can imagine, looking at the email headers and trying to develop more sophisticated features to capture this sort of email routing information to identify if something is spam. Something else you might consider doing is to look at the email message body, that is the email text, and try to develop more sophisticated features. For example, should the word ‘discount’ and the word ‘discounts’ be treated as the same words or should we have treat the words ‘deal’ and ‘dealer’ as the same word? Maybe even though one is lower case and one in capitalized in this example. Or do we want more complex features about punctuation because maybe spam is using exclamation marks a lot more. I don’t know. And along the same lines, maybe we also want to develop more sophisticated algorithms to detect and maybe to correct to deliberate misspellings, like mortgage, medicine, watches. Because spammers actually do this, because if you have watches with a 4 in there then well, with the simple technique that we talked about just now, the spam classifier might not equate this as the same thing as the word “watches,” and so it may have a harder time realizing that something is spam with these deliberate misspellings. And this is why spammers do it. While working on a machine learning problem, very often you can brainstorm lists of different things to try, like these. By the way, I’ve actually worked on the spam problem myself for a while. And I actually spent quite some time on it. And even though I kind of understand the spam problem, I actually know a bit about it, I would actually have a very hard time telling you of these four options which is the best use of your time so what happens, frankly what happens far too often is that a research group or product group will randomly fixate on one of these options. And sometimes that turns out not to be the most fruitful way to spend your time depending, you know, on which of these options someone ends up randomly fixating on. By the way, in fact, if you even get to the stage where you brainstorm a list of different options to try, you’re probably already ahead of the curve. Sadly, what most people do is instead of trying to list out the options of things you might try, what far too many people do is wake up one morning and, for some reason, just, you know, have a weird gut feeling that, “Oh let’s have a huge honeypot project to go and collect tons more data” and for whatever strange reason just sort of wake up one morning and randomly fixate on one thing and just work on that for six months. But I think we can do better. And in particular what I’d like to do in the next video is tell you about the concept of error analysis and talk about the way where you can try to have a more systematic way to choose amongst the options of the many different things you might work, and therefore be more likely to select what is actually a good way to spend your time, you know for the next few weeks, or next few days or the next few months.</p><p><strong>System Design Example:</strong></p><p>Given a data set of emails, we could construct a vector for each email. Each entry in this vector represents a word. The vector normally contains 10,000 to 50,000 entries gathered by finding the most frequently used words in our data set. If a word is to be found in the email, we would assign its respective entry a 1, else if it is not found, that entry would be a 0. Once we have all our x vectors ready, we train our algorithm and finally, we could use it to classify if an email is a spam or not.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/2.png" alt="Building_a_spam_classifier"></p><p>So how could you spend your time to improve the accuracy of this classifier?</p><ul><li><p>Collect lots of data (for example “honeypot” project but doesn’t always work)</p></li><li><p>Develop sophisticated features (for example: using email header data in spam emails)</p></li><li><p>Develop sophisticated features for message body (for example: should“discount” and “discounts” be treated as the same word? How about “deal” and “Dealer”? Features about punctuation)?</p></li><li><p>Develop algorithms to process your input in different ways (recognizing misspellings in spam, for example, med1cine, m0rtgage, w4tches).</p><p>It is difficult to tell which of the options will be most helpful.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Error-Analysis"><a href="#Error-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Error Analysis"></a>Error Analysis</h2><p>The recommended approach to solving machine learning problems is to:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Start with a simple algorithm, implement it quickly, and test it early on your cross validation data.</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Plot learning curves to decide if more data, more features, etc. are likely to help.</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Manually examine the errors on examples in the cross validation set and try to spot a trend where most of the errors were made.</em></strong></li></ul><p>For example, assume that we have 500 emails and our algorithm misclassifies a 100 of them. We could manually analyze the 100 emails and categorize them based on what type of emails they are. We could then try to come up with new cues and features that would help us classify these 100 emails correctly. Hence, if most of our misclassified emails are those which try to steal passwords, then we could find some features that are particular to those emails and add them to our model.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/3.png" alt="error_analysis"></p><p>We could also see how classifying each word according to its root changes our error rate:</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/4.png" alt="The_importance_of_numerical_evaluation"></p><p>It is very important to get error results as a single, numerical value. Otherwise it is difficult to assess your algorithm’s performance. For example if we use stemming, which is the process of treating the same word with different forms (fail/failing/failed) as one word (fail), and get a 3% error rate instead of 5%, then we should definitely add it to our model. However, if we try to distinguish between upper case and lower case letters and end up getting a 3.2% error rate instead of 3%, then we should avoid using this new feature. Hence, we should try new things, get a numerical value for our error rate, and based on our result decide whether we want to keep the new feature or not.</p><h1 id="02-handling-skewed-data"><a href="#02-handling-skewed-data" class="headerlink" title="02_handling-skewed-data"></a>02_handling-skewed-data</h1><h2 id="01-error-metrics-for-skewed-classes"><a href="#01-error-metrics-for-skewed-classes" class="headerlink" title="01_error-metrics-for-skewed-classes"></a>01_error-metrics-for-skewed-classes</h2><p>In the previous video, I talked about error analysis and the importance of having error metrics, that is of having a single real number evaluation metric for your learning algorithm to tell how well it’s doing.</p><p>In the context of evaluation and of error metrics, there is one important case, where it’s particularly tricky to come up with an appropriate error metric, or evaluation metric, for your learning algorithm. That case is the case of what’s called <strong>skewed classes</strong>. Let me tell you what that means.</p><p>Consider the problem of cancer classification, where we have features of medical patients and we want to decide whether or not they have cancer. So this is like the malignant versus benign tumor classification example that we had earlier. So let’s say y equals 1 if the patient has cancer and y equals 0 if they do not. We have trained the progression classifier and let’s say we test our classifier on a test set and find that we get 1 percent error. So, we’re making 99% correct diagnosis. Seems like a really impressive result, right. We’re correct 99% percent of the time.</p><p>But now, let’s say we find out that only 0.5 percent of patients in our training test sets actually have cancer. So only half a percent of the patients that come through our screening process have cancer. In this case, the 1% error no longer looks so impressive.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/5.png" alt="cancer_classification_example_of_skewed-class"></p><p>And in particular, here’s a piece of code, here’s actually a piece of non learning code that takes this input of features x and it ignores it. <strong><em>It just sets y equals 0 and always predicts, you know, nobody has cancer and this algorithm would actually get 0.5 percent error. So this is even better than the 1% error that we were getting just now and this is a non learning algorithm that you know, it is just predicting y equals 0 all the time. So this setting of when the ratio of positive to negative examples is very close to one of two extremes, where, in this case, the number of positive examples is much, much smaller than the number of negative examples because y equals one so rarely, this is what we call the case of skewed classes.</em></strong></p><p>We just have a lot more of examples from one class than from the other class. And by just predicting y equals 0 all the time, or maybe our predicting y equals 1 all the time, an algorithm can do pretty well. So the problem with using classification error or classification accuracy as our evaluation metric is the following.</p><p>Let’s say you have one joining algorithm that’s getting 99.2% accuracy. So, that’s a 0.8% error. Let’s say you make a change to your algorithm and you now are getting 99.5% accuracy. That is 0.5% error. So, is this an improvement to the algorithm or not? One of the nice things about having a single real number evaluation metric is this helps us to quickly decide if we just need a good change to the algorithm or not. <strong>By going from 99.2% accuracy to 99.5% accuracy. You know, did we just do something useful or did we just replace our code with something that just predicts y equals zero more often? So, if you have very skewed classes it becomes much harder to use just classification accuracy, because you can get very high classification accuracies or very low errors, and it’s not always clear if doing so is really improving the quality of your classifier because predicting y equals 0 all the time doesn’t seem like a particularly good classifier.</strong> But just predicting y equals 0 more often can bring your error down to, you know, maybe as low as 0.5%.</p><p>When we’re faced with such a skewed classes therefore we would want to come up with a different error metric or a different evaluation metric. One such evaluation metric are what’s called <strong>precision and recall</strong>. Let me explain what that is. Let’s say we are evaluating a classifier on the test set. For the examples in the test set the actual class of that example in the test set is going to be either one or zero, right, if there is a binary classification problem. And what our learning algorithm will do is it will, you know, predict some value for the class and our learning algorithm will predict the value for each example in my test set and the predicted value will also be either one or zero. So let me draw a two by two table as follows, depending on a full of these entries depending on what was the actual class and what was the predicted class. If we have an example where the actual class is one and the predicted class is one then that’s called an example that’s a <strong><em>true positive</em></strong>, meaning our algorithm predicted that it’s positive and in reality the example is positive. If our learning algorithm predicted that something is negative, class zero, and the actual class is also class zero then that’s what’s called a <strong><em>true negative</em></strong>. We predicted zero and it actually is zero. To find the other two boxes, if our learning algorithm predicts that the class is one but the actual class is zero, then that’s called a <strong><em>false positive</em></strong>. So that means our algorithm for the patient is cancelled out in reality if the patient does not. And finally, the last box is a zero, one. That’s called a <strong><em>false negative</em></strong> because our algorithm predicted zero, but the actual class was one. And so, we have this little sort of two by two table based on what was the actual class and what was the predicted class. So here’s a different way of evaluating the performance of our algorithm. We’re going to compute two numbers.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/6.png" alt="definitions_of_precision_and_recall"></p><p>The first is called <strong><em>precision</em></strong> - and what that says is, of all the patients where we’ve predicted that they have cancer, what fraction of them actually have cancer? So let me write this down, the precision of a classifier is the number of true positives divided by the number that we predicted as positive, right? So of all the patients that we went to those patients and we told them, “We think you have cancer.” Of all those patients, what fraction of them actually have cancer? So that’s called precision. <strong>And another way to write this would be true positives and then in the denominator is the number of predicted positives, and so that would be the sum of the, you know, entries in this first row of the table. So it would be true positives divided by positives. I’m going to abbreviate positive as POS and then plus false positives, again abbreviating positive using POS.</strong> So that’s called precision, and as you can tell high precision would be good. That means that all the patients that we went to and we said, “You know, we’re very sorry. We think you have cancer,” <strong><em>high precision</em></strong> means that of that group of patients most of them we had actually made accurate predictions on them and they do have cancer.</p><p>The second number we’re going to compute is called <strong><em>recall</em></strong>, and what recall say is, if all the patients in, let’s say, in the test set or the cross-validation set, but if all the patients in the data set that actually have cancer, what fraction of them that we correctly detect as having cancer. So if all the patients have cancer, how many of them did we actually go to them and you know, correctly told them that we think they need treatment. <strong>So, writing this down, recall is defined as the number of positives, the number of true positives, meaning the number of people that have cancer and that we correctly predicted have cancer and we take that and divide that by, divide that by the number of actual positives, so this is the right number of actual positives of all the people that do have cancer.</strong> What fraction do we directly flag and you know, send the treatment. So, to rewrite this in a different form, the denominator would be the number of actual positives as you know, is the sum of the entries in this first column over here. And so writing things out differently, this is therefore, the number of true positives, divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives. And so once again, having a high recall would be a good thing.</p><p>So by computing precision and recall this will usually give us a better sense of how well our classifier is doing. And in particular if we have a learning algorithm that predicts y equals zero all the time, if it predicts no one has cancer, then this classifier will have a recall equal to zero, because there won’t be any true positives and so that’s a quick way for us to recognize that, you know, a classifier that predicts y equals 0 all the time, just isn’t a very good classifier. And more generally, even for settings where we have very skewed classes, it’s not possible for an algorithm to sort of “cheat” and somehow get a very high precision and a very high recall by doing some simple thing like predicting y equals 0 all the time or predicting y equals 1 all the time. <strong>And so we’re much more sure that a classifier of a high precision or high recall actually is a good classifier, and this gives us a more useful evaluation metric that is a more direct way to actually understand whether, you know, our algorithm may be doing well.</strong> So one final note in the definition of precision and recall, that we would define precision and recall, usually we use the convention that y is equal to 1, in the presence of the more rare class. So if we are trying to detect. rare conditions such as cancer, hopefully that’s a rare condition, precision and recall are defined setting y equals 1, rather than y equals 0, to be sort of that the presence of that rare class that we’re trying to detect. And by using precision and recall, we find, what happens is that even if we have very skewed classes, it’s not possible for an algorithm to you know, “cheat” and predict y equals 1 all the time, or predict y equals 0 all the time, and get high precision and recall. And in particular, if a classifier is getting high precision and high recall, then we are actually confident that the algorithm has to be doing well, even if we have very skewed classes. <strong><em>So for the problem of skewed classes precision recall gives us more direct insight into how the learning algorithm is doing and this is often a much better way to evaluate our learning algorithms, than looking at classification error or classification accuracy, when the classes are very skewed.</em></strong></p><h2 id="02-trading-off-precision-and-recall"><a href="#02-trading-off-precision-and-recall" class="headerlink" title="02_trading-off-precision-and-recall"></a>02_trading-off-precision-and-recall</h2><p>In the last video,we talked about precision and recall as an evaluation metric for classification problems with skewed constants. <strong>For many applications, we’ll want to somehow control the trade-off between precision and recall.</strong> Let me tell you how to do that and also show you some even more effective ways to use precision and recall as an evaluation metric for learning algorithms.</p><p>As a reminder,here are the definitions of precision and recall from the previous video. Let’s continue our cancer classification example, where y equals 1 if the patient has cancer and y equals 0 otherwise. And let’s say we’re trained in logistic regression classifier which outputs probability between 0 and 1. So, as usual, we’re going to predict 1, y equals 1, if h(x) is greater or equal to 0.5. And predict 0 if the hypothesis outputs a value less than 0.5. And this classifier may give us some value for precision and some value for recall. But now, suppose we want to predict that the patient has cancer only if we’re very confident that they really do. Because if you go to a patient and you tell them that they have cancer, it’s going to give them a huge shock. What we give is a seriously bad news, and they may end up going through a pretty painful treatment process and so on. And so maybe we want to tell someone that we think they have cancer only if they are very confident. One way to do this would be to modify the algorithm, so that instead of setting this threshold at 0.5, we might instead say that we will predict that y is equal to 1 only if h(x) is greater or equal to 0.7. So this is like saying, we’ll tell someone they have cancer only if we think there’s a greater than or equal to, 70% chance that they have cancer. And, if you do this, then you’re predicting someone has cancer<br>only when you’re more confident and so you end up with a classifier that has higher precision. Because all of the patients that you’re going to and saying, we think you have cancer, although those patients are now ones that you’re pretty confident actually have cancer. And <strong>so a higher fraction of the patients that you predict have cancer will actually turn out to have cancer because making those predictions only if we’re pretty confident. But in contrast this classifier will have lower recall because now we’re going to make predictions, we’re going to predict y = 1 on a smaller number of patients.</strong> Now, can even take this further. Instead of setting the threshold at 0.7, we can set this at 0.9. Now we’ll predict y=1 only if we are more than 90% certain that the patient has cancer. And so, a large fraction of those patients will turn out to have cancer. And so this would be a higher precision classifier will have lower recall because we want to correctly detect that those patients have cancer. <strong>Now consider a different example. Suppose we want to avoid missing too many actual cases of cancer, so we want to avoid false negatives. In particular, if a patient actually has cancer, but we fail to tell them that they have cancer then that can be really bad. Because if we tell a patient that they don’t have cancer, then they’re not going to go for treatment. And if it turns out that they have cancer, but we fail to tell them they have cancer, well, they may not get treated at all. And so that would be a really bad outcome because they die because we told them that they don’t have cancer. They fail to get treated, but it turns out they actually have cancer.</strong> So, suppose that, when in doubt, we want to predict that y=1. So, when in doubt, we want to predict that they have cancer so that at least they look further into it, and these can get treated in case they do turn out to have cancer. <strong>In this case, rather than setting higher probability threshold, we might instead take this value and instead set it to a lower value.</strong> So maybe 0.3 like so, right? And by doing so, we’re saying that,you know what, if we think there’s more than a 30% chance that they have cancer we better be more conservative and tell them that they may have cancer so that they can seek treatment if necessary. <strong>And in this case what we would have is going to be a higher recall classifier, because we’re going to be correctly flagging a higher fraction of all of the patients that actually do have cancer.</strong> But we’re going to end up with lower precision because a higher fraction of the patients that we said have cancer, a high fraction of them will turnout not to have cancer after all. And by the way, just as a sider, when I talk about this to other students, I’ve been told before, it’s pretty amazing, some of my students say, is how I can tell the story both ways. <strong>Why we might want to have higher precision or higher recall and the story actually seems to work both ways. But I hope the details of the algorithm is true and the more general principle is depending on where you want, whether you want higher precision- lower recall, or higher recall- lower precision.</strong></p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/7.png" alt="trading-off_precision_and_recall"></p><p>You can end up predicting y=1 when h(x) is greater than some threshold. And so in general, for most classifiers there is going to be a trade off between precision and recall, and as you vary the value of this threshold that we join here, you can actually plot out some curve that trades off precision and recall. Where a value up here, this would correspond to a very high value of the threshold, maybe threshold equals 0.99. So that’s saying, predict y=1 only if we’re more than 99% confident, at least 99% probability this one. So that would be a high precision, relatively low recall. Where as the point down here, will correspond to a value of the threshold that’s much lower, maybe equal 0.01, meaning, when in doubt at all, predict y=1, and if you do that, you end up with a much lower precision, higher recall classifier. And as you vary the threshold, if you want you can actually trace of a curve for your classifier to see the range of different values you can get for precision recall. And by the way, the precision-recall curve can look like many different shapes. Sometimes it will look like this, sometimes it will look like that. Now there are many different possible shapes for the precision-recall curve, depending on the details of the classifier.</p><p><strong>So, this raises another interesting question which is, is there a way to choose this threshold automatically? Or more generally, if we have a few different algorithms or a few different ideas for algorithms, how do we compare different precision recall numbers? Concretely, suppose we have three different learning algorithms. So actually, maybe these are three different learning algorithms, maybe these are the same algorithm but just with different values for the threshold. How do we decide which of these algorithms is best?</strong></p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/8.png" alt="F1_score"></p><h1 id="03-using-large-data-sets"><a href="#03-using-large-data-sets" class="headerlink" title="03_using-large-data-sets"></a>03_using-large-data-sets</h1><p>In the previous video, we talked about evaluation metrics. In this video, I’d like to switch tracks a bit and touch on another important aspect of machine learning system design, which will often come up, which is <strong>the issue of how much data to train on</strong>.</p><p>Now, in some earlier videos, <strong><em>I had cautioned against blindly going out and just spending lots of time collecting lots of data, because it’s only sometimes that that would actually help.</em></strong> But it turns out that under certain conditions, and I will say in this video what those conditions are, <strong><em>getting a lot of data and training on a certain type of learning algorithm, can be a very effective way to get a learning algorithm to do very good performance. And this arises often enough that if those conditions hold true for your problem and if you’re able to get a lot of data, this could be a very good way to get a very high performance learning algorithm.</em></strong> So in this video, let’s talk more about that. Let me start with a story.</p><h2 id="Michelle-Banko-and-Eric-Broule"><a href="#Michelle-Banko-and-Eric-Broule" class="headerlink" title="Michelle Banko and Eric Broule"></a>Michelle Banko and Eric Broule</h2><p>Many, many years ago, two researchers that I know, Michelle Banko and Eric Broule ran the following fascinating study. They were interested in studying the effect of using different learning algorithms versus trying them out on different training set sciences, they were considering the problem of classifying between confusable words, so for example, in the sentence: for breakfast I ate, should it be to, two or too? Well, for this example, for breakfast I ate two, 2 eggs. So, this is one example of a set of confusable words and that’s a different set. So they took machine learning problems like these, sort of supervised learning problems to try to categorize what is the appropriate word to go into a certain position in an English sentence.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/9.png" alt="img"></p><p>They took a few different learning algorithms which were, you know, sort of considered state of the art back in the day, when they ran the study in 2001, so they took a variance, roughly a variance on logistic regression called the Perceptron. They also took some of their algorithms that were fairly out back then but somewhat less used now so when the algorithm also very similar to which is a regression but different in some ways, much used somewhat less, used not too much right now took what’s called a memory based learning algorithm again used somewhat less now. But I’ll talk a little bit about that later. And they used a naive based algorithm, which is something they’ll actually talk about in this course. The exact algorithms of these details aren’t important. Think of this as, you know, just picking four different classification algorithms and really the exact algorithms aren’t important. <strong>But what they did was they varied the training set size and tried out these learning algorithms on the range of training set sizes and that’s the result they got.</strong></p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/10.png" alt="img"></p><p>And the trends are very clear, right?</p><ol><li>first, most of these algorithms give remarkably similar performance.</li><li>And second, as the training set size increases, on the horizontal axis is the training set size in millions go from, you know, a hundred thousand up to a thousand million that is a billion training examples. The performance of the algorithms all pretty much monotonically increase and the fact that if you pick any algorithm, may be pick a “inferior algorithm”, but if you give that “inferior algorithm” more data, then from these examples, it looks like it will most likely beat even a “superior algorithm”.</li></ol><p>So since this original study which is very influential, <strong>there’s been a range of many different studies showing similar results that show that many different learning algorithms you know tend to, can sometimes, depending on details, can give pretty similar ranges of performance, but what can really drive performance is you can give the algorithm a ton of training data.</strong> And this is, results like these has led to a saying in machine learning that often in machine learning <strong>it’s not who has the best algorithm that wins, it’s who has the most data So when is this true and when is this not true?</strong> Because we have a learning algorithm for which this is true then getting a lot of data is often maybe the best way to ensure that we have an algorithm with very high performance rather than you know, debating worrying about exactly which of these items to use.</p><h2 id="the-features-x-have-sufficient-information"><a href="#the-features-x-have-sufficient-information" class="headerlink" title="the features x have sufficient information"></a>the features x have sufficient information</h2><p>Let’s try to lay out a set of assumptions under which having a massive training set we think will be able to help. Let’s assume that in our machine learning problem, the features x have sufficient information, with which we can use to predict y accurately.</p><p>For example, if we take the confusable words all of them that we had on the previous slide. Let’s say that it features x capture what are the surrounding words around the blank that we’re trying to fill in. So the features capture then we want to have, sometimes for breakfast I have black eggs. Then yeah that is pretty much information to tell me that the word I want in the middle is TWO and that is not word TO and its not the word TOO. <strong>So the features capture, you know, one of these surrounding words then that gives me enough information to pretty unambiguously decide what is the label y or in other words what is the word that I should be using to fill in that blank out of this set of three confusable words.</strong> So that’s an example what the futures x has sufficient information for specific y.</p><p>For a counter example. <strong>Consider a problem of predicting the price of a house from only the size of the house and from no other features.</strong> So if you imagine I tell you that a house is, you know, 500 square feet but I don’t give you any other features. I don’t tell you that the house is in an expensive part of the city. Or if I don’t tell you that the house, the number of rooms in the house, or how nicely furnished the house is, or whether the house is new or old. If I don’t tell you anything other than that this is a 500 square foot house, well there’s so many other factors that would affect the price of a house other than just the size of a house that if all you know is the size, it’s actually very difficult to predict the price accurately. So that would be a counter example to this assumption that the features have sufficient information to predict the price to the desired level of accuracy.</p><h2 id="domain-knowledge"><a href="#domain-knowledge" class="headerlink" title="domain knowledge"></a>domain knowledge</h2><p>The way I think about testing this assumption, one way I often think about it is, how often I ask myself. Given the input features x, given the features, given the same information available as well as learning algorithm. If we were to go to <strong>human expert in this domain</strong>. Can a human experts actually or can human expert confidently predict the value of y. <strong><em>For this first example if we go to, you know an expert human English speaker.</em></strong> You go to someone that speaks English well, right, then a human expert in English just read most people like you and me will probably we would probably be able to predict what word should go in here, to a good English speaker can predict this well, and so this gives me confidence that x allows us to predict y accurately, but in contrast if we go to <strong><em>an expert in house prices.</em></strong> Like maybe an expert realtor, right, someone who sells houses for a living. If I just tell them the size of a house and I tell them what the price is well even an expert in pricing or selling houses wouldn’t be able to tell me and so this is fine that for the housing price example knowing only the size doesn’t give me enough information to predict the price of the house. So, let’s say, this assumption holds. Let’s see then, when having a lot of data could help. Suppose the features have enough information to predict the value of y.</p><p>And let’s suppose we use a learning algorithm with a large number of parameters so maybe logistic regression or linear regression with a large number of features. Or one thing that I sometimes do, one thing that I often do actually is using neural network with many hidden units. That would be another learning algorithm with a lot of parameters. So these are all powerful learning algorithms with a lot of parameters that can fit very complex functions. So, I’m going to call these, I’m going to think of these as low-bias algorithms because you know we can fit very complex functions and because we have a very powerful learning algorithm, they can fit very complex functions. Chances are, if we run these algorithms on the data sets, it will be able to fit the training set well, and so hopefully the training error will be slow.</p><h2 id="Large-data-rationale"><a href="#Large-data-rationale" class="headerlink" title="Large data rationale"></a>Large data rationale</h2><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/11/11.png" alt="img"></p><p><strong>Now let’s say, we use a massive, massive training set, in that case, if we have a huge training set, then hopefully even though we have a lot of parameters but if the training set is sort of even much larger than the number of parameters then hopefully these albums will be unlikely to overfit.</strong> Right, <strong>because we have such a massive training set and by unlikely to overfit what that means is that the training error will hopefully be close to the test error.</strong> Finally putting these two together that the train set error is small and the test set error is close to the training error what this two together imply is that hopefully the test set error will also be small.</p><p><strong>Another way to think about this is that in order to have a high performance learning algorithm we want it not to have high bias and not to have high variance. So the bias problem we’re going to address by making sure we have a learning algorithm with many parameters and so that gives us a low bias algorithm and by using a very large training set, this ensures that we don’t have a variance problem here.</strong> So hopefully our algorithm will have no variance and so is by pulling these two together, that we end up with a low bias and a low variance learning algorithm and this allows us to do well on the test set. And fundamentally it’s a key ingredients of assuming that the features have enough information and we have a rich class of functions that’s why it guarantees low bias, and then it having a massive training set that that’s what guarantees more variance. So this gives us a set of conditions rather hopefully some understanding of what’s the sort of problem where if you have a lot of data and you train a learning algorithm with lot of parameters, that might be a good way to give a high performance learning algorithm</p><h2 id="The-Key-Test"><a href="#The-Key-Test" class="headerlink" title="The Key Test"></a>The Key Test</h2><p>and really, I think <strong>the key test</strong> that I often ask myself are <strong>first</strong>, can a human experts look at the features x and confidently predict the value of y. Because that’s sort of a certification that y can be predicted accurately from the features x and <strong>second</strong>, can we actually get a large training set, and train the learning algorithm with a lot of parameters in the training set and if you can’t do both then that’s more often give you a very kind performance learning algorithm.</p><h1 id="summary"><a href="#summary" class="headerlink" title="summary"></a>summary</h1><h2 id="Prioritizing-What-to-Work-On-1"><a href="#Prioritizing-What-to-Work-On-1" class="headerlink" title="Prioritizing What to Work On"></a>Prioritizing What to Work On</h2><p>Different ways we can approach a machine learning problem:</p><ul><li>Collect lots of data (for example “honeypot” project but doesn’t always work)</li><li>Develop sophisticated features (for example: using email header data in spam emails)</li><li>Develop algorithms to process your input in different ways (recognizing misspellings in spam).</li></ul><p>It is difficult to tell which of the options will be helpful.</p><h2 id="Error-Analysis-1"><a href="#Error-Analysis-1" class="headerlink" title="Error Analysis"></a>Error Analysis</h2><p>The recommended approach to solving machine learning problems is:</p><ul><li>Start with a simple algorithm, implement it quickly, and test it early.</li><li>Plot learning curves to decide if more data, more features, etc. will help</li><li>Error analysis: manually examine the errors on examples in the cross validation set and try to spot a trend.</li></ul><p>It’s important to get error results as a single, numerical value. Otherwise it is difficult to assess your algorithm’s performance.<br>You may need to process your input before it is useful. For example, if your input is a set of words, you may want to treat the same word with different forms (fail/failing/failed) as one word, so must use “stemming software” to recognize them all as one.</p><h2 id="Error-Metrics-for-Skewed-Classes"><a href="#Error-Metrics-for-Skewed-Classes" class="headerlink" title="Error Metrics for Skewed Classes"></a>Error Metrics for Skewed Classes</h2><p>It is sometimes difficult to tell whether a reduction in error is actually an improvement of the algorithm.</p><p>For example: In predicting a cancer diagnoses where 0.5% of the examples have cancer, we find our learning algorithm has a 1% error. However, if we were to simply classify every single example as a 0, then our error would reduce to 0.5% even though we did not improve the algorithm.</p><p>This usually happens with <strong>skewed classes</strong> ; that is, when our class is very rare in the entire data set.<br>Or to say it another way, when we have lot more examples from one class than from the other class.<br>For this we can use <strong>Precision/Recall</strong> .</p><ul><li>Predicted: 1, Actual: 1 — True positive</li><li>Predicted: 0, Actual: 0 — True negative</li><li>Predicted: 0, Actual, 1 — False negative</li><li>Predicted: 1, Actual: 0 — False positive</li></ul><p><strong>Precision</strong> : of all patients we predicted where y=1, what fraction actually has cancer?<br>$$\dfrac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{Total number of predicted positives}} = \dfrac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives}+\text{False positives}}$$<br><strong>Recall</strong> : Of all the patients that actually have cancer, what fraction did we correctly detect as having cancer?<br>$$\dfrac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{Total number of actual positives}}= \dfrac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives}+\text{False negatives}}$$<br>These two metrics give us a better sense of how our classifier is doing. We want both precision and recall to be high.<br>In the example at the beginning of the section, if we classify all patients as 0, then our <strong>recall</strong> will be $\dfrac{0}{0 + f} = 0$, so despite having a lower error percentage, we can quickly see it has worse recall.<br>Accuracy = $\frac {true\ positive + true\ negative} {total\ population}$<br>Note 1: if an algorithm predicts only negatives like it does in one of exercises, the precision is not defined, it is impossible to divide by 0. F1 score will not be defined too.</p><h2 id="Trading-Off-Precision-and-Recall"><a href="#Trading-Off-Precision-and-Recall" class="headerlink" title="Trading Off Precision and Recall"></a>Trading Off Precision and Recall</h2><p>We might want a <strong>confident prediction</strong> of two classes using logistic regression. One way is to increase our threshold:<br>Predict 1 if: $h_\theta(x) \geq 0.7$<br>Predict 0 if: $h_\theta(x) &lt; 0.7$<br>This way, we only predict cancer if the patient has a 70% chance.<br>Doing this, we will have <strong>higher precision</strong> but <strong>but lower recall</strong>(refer to the definitions in the previous section).<br>In the opposite example, we can lower our threshold:<br>Predict 1 if: $h_\theta(x) \geq 0.3$<br>Predict 0 if: $h_\theta(x) &lt; 0.3$<br>That way, we get a very <strong>safe prediction</strong>. This will cause higher recall but lower precision .<br>The greater the threshold, the greater the precision and the lower the recall.<br>The lower the threshold, the greater the recall and the lower the precision.<br>In order to turn these two metrics into one single number, we can take the <strong>F value</strong> .<br>One way is to take the <strong>average</strong> :<br>$$\dfrac{P+R}{2}$$<br>This does not work well. If we predict all y=0 then that will bring the average up despite having 0 recall. If we predict all examples as y=1, then the very high recall will bring up the average despite having 0 precision.<br>A better way is to compute the F Score (or <strong>F1 score</strong>):<br>$$\text{F Score} = 2\dfrac{PR}{P + R}$$<br>In order for the F Score to be large, both precision and recall must be large.<br>We want to train precision and recall on <strong>the cross validation</strong> set so as not to bias our test set.</p><h2 id="Data-for-Machine-Learning"><a href="#Data-for-Machine-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Data for Machine Learning"></a>Data for Machine Learning</h2><p>How much data should we train on?<br>In certain cases, an “inferior algorithm,” if given enough data, can outperform a superior algorithm with less data.<br>We must choose our features to have <strong>enough</strong> information. A useful test is: Given input x, would a human expert be able to confidently predict y?<br><strong>Rationale for large data</strong> : if we have a low bias algorithm (many features or hidden units making a very complex function), then the larger the training set we use, the less we will have overfitting (and the more accurate the algorithm will be on the test set).</p><h2 id="Quiz-instructions"><a href="#Quiz-instructions" class="headerlink" title="Quiz instructions"></a>Quiz instructions</h2><p>When the quiz instructions tell you to enter a value to “two decimal digits”, what it really means is “two significant digits”. So, just for example, the value 0.0123 should be entered as “0.012”, not “0.01”.<br>References:<br><a href="https://class.coursera.org/ml/lecture/index" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://class.coursera.org/ml/lecture/index</a><br><a href="http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/~srihari/CSE555/Chap9.Part2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/~srihari/CSE555/Chap9.Part2.pdf</a><br><a href="http://blog.stephenpurpura.com/post/13052575854/managing-bias-variance-tradeoff-in-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://blog.stephenpurpura.com/post/13052575854/managing-bias-variance-tradeoff-in-machine-learning</a><br><a href="http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/~srihari/CSE574/Chap3/Bias-Variance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/~srihari/CSE574/Chap3/Bias-Variance.pdf</a></p>

          <p>By now you have seen a lot of different learning algorithms. And if you’ve been following along these videos you should consider yourself an expert on many state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. <strong>But even among people that know a certain learning algorithm. There’s often a huge difference between someone that really knows how to powerfully and effectively apply that algorithm, versus someone that’s less familiar with some of the material that I’m about to teach and who doesn’t really understand how to apply these algorithms and can end up wasting a lot of their time trying things out that don’t really make sense.</strong></p><p>What I would like to do is make sure that if you are developing machine learning systems, that you know how to choose one of the most promising avenues to spend your time pursuing. And on this and the next few videos I’m going to give a number of practical suggestions, advice, guidelines on how to do that.</p><p>And concretely what we’d focus on is the problem of, suppose you are developing a machine learning system or trying to improve the performance of a machine learning system, how do you go about deciding what are the proxy avenues to try next?</p><p>To explain this, let’s continue using our example of learning to predict housing prices. And let’s say you’ve implement and regularize linear regression. Thus minimizing that cost function j. Now suppose that after you take your learn parameters, if you test your hypothesis on the new set of houses, suppose you find that this is making huge errors in this prediction of the housing prices. The question is what should you then try mixing in order to improve the learning algorithm?</p><p>There are many things that one can think of that could improve the performance of the learning algorithm.</p><p>One thing they could try, is to get more training examples. And concretely, you can imagine, maybe, you know, setting up phone surveys, going door to door, to try to get more data on how much different houses sell for. And the sad thing is I’ve seen a lot of people spend a lot of time collecting more training examples, thinking oh, if we have twice as much or ten times as much training data, that is certainly going to help, right? <strong>But sometimes getting more training data doesn’t actually help and in the next few videos we will see why, and we will see how you can avoid spending a lot of time collecting more training data in settings where it is just not going to help.</strong></p><p>Other things you might try are to well maybe try a smaller set of features. So if you have some set of features such as x1, x2, x3 and so on, maybe a large number of features. Maybe you want to spend time carefully selecting some small subset of them to prevent overfitting. Or maybe you need to get additional features. Maybe the current set of features aren’t informative enough and you want to collect more data in the sense of getting more features.</p><p>And once again this is the sort of project that can scale up the huge projects can you imagine getting phone surveys to find out more houses, or extra land surveys to find out more about the pieces of land and so on, so a huge project. And once again it would be nice to know in advance if this is going to help before we spend a lot of time doing something like this. We can also try adding polynomial features things like x2 square x2 square and product features x1, x2. We can still spend quite a lot of time thinking about that and we can also try other things like decreasing lambda, the regularization parameter or increasing lambda. Given a menu of options like these, some of which can easily scale up to six month or longer projects.</p><p><strong>Unfortunately, the most common method that people use to pick one of these is to go by</strong> <strong><em>gut feeling</em></strong>. In which what many people will do is sort of randomly pick one of these options and maybe say, “Oh, lets go and get more training data.” And easily spend six months collecting more training data or maybe someone else would rather be saying, “Well, let’s go collect a lot more features on these houses in our data set.” And I have a lot of times, sadly seen people spend, you know, literally 6 months doing one of these avenues that they have sort of at random only to discover six months later that that really wasn’t a promising avenue to pursue.</p><p><strong>Fortunately, there is a pretty simple technique that can let you very quickly rule out half of the things on this list as being potentially promising things to pursue.</strong> And there is a very simple technique, that if you run, can easily rule out many of these options, and potentially save you a lot of time pursuing something that’s just is not going to work.</p><p>In the next two videos after this, I’m going to first talk about <strong>how to evaluate learning algorithms</strong>. And in the next few videos after that, I’m going to talk about these techniques, which are called <strong>the machine learning diagnostics</strong>. And what a diagnostic is, is a test you can run, to get insight into what is or isn’t working with an algorithm, and which will often give you insight as to what are promising things to try to improve a learning algorithm’s performance. We’ll talk about specific diagnostics later in this video sequence. But I should mention in advance that diagnostics can take time to implement and can sometimes, you know, take quite a lot of time to implement and understand but doing so can be a very good use of your time when you are developing learning algorithms because they can often save you from spending many months pursuing an avenue that you could have found out much earlier just was not going to be fruitful. So in the next few videos, I’m going to first talk about how evaluate your learning algorithms and after that I’m going to talk about some of these diagnostics which will hopefully let you much more effectively select more of the useful things to try mixing if your goal to improve the machine learning system.</p><h1 id="01-evaluating-a-learning-algorithm"><a href="#01-evaluating-a-learning-algorithm" class="headerlink" title="01_evaluating-a-learning-algorithm"></a>01_evaluating-a-learning-algorithm</h1><h2 id="Evaluating-a-Hypothesis"><a href="#Evaluating-a-Hypothesis" class="headerlink" title="Evaluating a Hypothesis"></a>Evaluating a Hypothesis</h2><p>Once we have done some trouble shooting for errors in our predictions by:</p><ul><li><p>Getting more training examples</p></li><li><p>Trying smaller sets of features</p></li><li><p>Trying additional features</p></li><li><p>Trying polynomial features</p></li><li><p>Increasing or decreasing λ</p><p>We can move on to evaluate our new hypothesis.</p></li></ul><p>A hypothesis may have a low error for the training examples but still be inaccurate (because of overfitting). Thus, to evaluate a hypothesis, given a dataset of training examples, we can split up the data into two sets: a <strong>training set</strong> and a <strong>test set</strong> . Typically, the training set consists of 70 % of your data and the test set is the remaining 30 %.</p><p>The new procedure using these two sets is then:</p><ol><li>Learn $\Theta$ and minimize $J_{train}(\Theta)$ using the training set</li><li>Compute the test set error $J_{test}(\Theta)$</li></ol><p>The test set error For linear regression: $J_{test}(\Theta) = \dfrac{1}{2m_{test}} \sum_{i=1}^{m_{test}}(h_\Theta(x^{(i)}<em>{test}) - y^{(i)}</em>{test})^2$</p><p>For classification ~ Misclassification error (aka 0/1 misclassification error):</p><p>$$err(h_\Theta(x),y) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \mbox{if } h_\Theta(x) \geq 0.5\ and\ y = 0\ or\ h_\Theta(x) &lt; 0.5\ and\ y = 1\newline 0 &amp; \mbox otherwise \end{cases}$$</p><p>This gives us a binary 0 or 1 error result based on a misclassification. The average test error for the test set is:</p><p>$$\text{Test Error} = \dfrac{1}{m_{test}} \sum^{m_{test}}<em>{i=1} err(h_\Theta(x^{(i)}</em>{test}), y^{(i)}_{test})$$</p><p>This gives us the proportion of the test data that was misclassified.</p><h2 id="Model-Selection-and-Train-Validation-Test-Sets"><a href="#Model-Selection-and-Train-Validation-Test-Sets" class="headerlink" title="Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets"></a>Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets</h2><p>Just because a learning algorithm fits a training set well, that does not mean it is a good hypothesis. It could <strong><em>overfit</em></strong> and as a result your predictions on the test set would be poor. <strong><em>The error of your hypothesis as measured on the data set with which you trained the parameters will be lower than the error on any other data set.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Given many models with different polynomial degrees, we can use a systematic approach to identify the ‘best’ function. In order to choose the model of your hypothesis, you can test each degree of polynomial and look at the error result.</strong></p><p>One way to break down our dataset into the three sets is:</p><ul><li>​ Training set: 60%</li><li>​ Cross validation set: 20%</li><li>​ Test set: 20%</li></ul><p>We can now calculate three separate error values for the three different sets using the following method:</p><ol><li>​ Optimize the parameters in $Θ $ using the training set for each polynomial degree.</li><li>​ Find the polynomial degree d with the least error using the cross validation set.</li><li>​ Estimate the generalization error using the test set with $J_{test}(Θ^{(d)})$, (d = theta from polynomial with lower error);</li></ol><p><strong>This way, the degree of the polynomial d has not been trained using the test set.</strong></p><p><em>Training error:</em><br>$$J_{train}\left(\theta\right) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_\limits{i=1}^{m}\left(h_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)}\right)-y^{(i)}\right)^2$$<br><em>Cross Validation error:</em><br>$$J_{cv}\left(\theta\right) = \frac{1}{2m_{cv}}\sum_\limits{i=1}^{m}\left(h_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)}<em>{cv}\right)-y^{(i)}</em>{cv}\right)^2$$<br><em>Test error:</em><br>$$J_{cv}\left(\theta\right) = \frac{1}{2m_{cv}}\sum_\limits{i=1}^{m}\left(h_{\theta}\left(x^{(i)}<em>{cv}\right)-y^{(i)}</em>{cv}\right)^2$$</p><h1 id="02-bias-vs-variance"><a href="#02-bias-vs-variance" class="headerlink" title="02_bias-vs-variance"></a>02_bias-vs-variance</h1><h2 id="Diagnosing-Bias-vs-Variance"><a href="#Diagnosing-Bias-vs-Variance" class="headerlink" title="Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance"></a>Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance</h2><p>In this section we examine the relationship between the degree of the polynomial d and the underfitting or overfitting of our hypothesis.</p><ul><li>We need to distinguish whether <strong>bias</strong> or <strong>variance</strong> is the problem contributing to bad predictions.</li><li>High bias is underfitting and high variance is overfitting.

On the other hand, as $\lambda$ approaches 0, we tend to over overfit the data. So how do we choose our parameter $\lambda$ to get it ‘just right’ ? In order to choose the model and the regularization term $λ$ , we need to:</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/10/6.png" alt="img"></p><ol><li>Create a list of lambdas (i.e.$ λ∈{0,0.01,0.02,0.04,0.08,0.16,0.32,0.64,1.28,2.56,5.12,10.24}$);</li><li>Create a set of models with different degrees or any other variants.</li><li><strong><em>Iterate through the $\lambda$s and for each $\lambda$ go through all the models to learn some $\Theta$ .</em></strong></li><li>Compute the cross validation error using the learned $Θ$ (computed with $λ$) on the $J_{CV}(\Theta)$ <strong>without</strong> regularization or $λ = 0$.</li><li>Select the best combo that produces the lowest error on the cross validation set.</li><li>Using the best combo $Θ$ and λ, apply it on $J_{test}(\Theta)$ to see if it has a good generalization of the problem.</li></ol><h2 id="Learning-Curves"><a href="#Learning-Curves" class="headerlink" title="Learning Curves"></a>Learning Curves</h2><p>Training an algorithm on a very few number of data points (such as 1, 2 or 3) will easily have 0 errors because we can always find a quadratic curve that touches exactly those number of points.

We denote $h_Θ(x)<em>k$ as being a hypothesis that results in the $k^{th}$output. Our cost function for neural networks is going to be a generalization of the one we used for logistic regression. Recall that the cost function for regularized logistic regression was :<br>$$<br>J(\theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum</em>{i=1}^m [ y^{(i)}\ \log (h_\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\ \log (1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))] + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2<br>$$<br>For neural networks, it is going to be slightly more complicated :<br>$$<br>\begin{gather<em>} J(\Theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{k=1}^K \left[y^{(i)}<em>k \log ((h_\Theta (x^{(i)}))_k) + (1 - y^{(i)}_k)\log (1 - (h_\Theta(x^{(i)}))_k)\right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum</em>{l=1}^{L-1} \sum_{i=1}^{s_l} \sum_{j=1}^{s_{l+1}} ( \Theta_{j,i}^{(l)})^2\end{gather</em>}<br>$$<br>We have added a few nested summations to account for our multiple output nodes. In the first part of the equation, before the square brackets, we have an additional nested summation that loops through the number of output nodes.</p><p><strong>In the regularization part, after the square brackets, we must account for multiple theta matrices. The number of columns in our current theta matrix is equal to the number of nodes in our current layer (including the bias unit). The number of rows in our current theta matrix is equal to the number of nodes in the next layer (excluding the bias unit).</strong> As before with logistic regression, we square every term.</p><p>Note:</p><ul><li><strong><em>the double sum simply adds up the logistic regression costs calculated for each cell in the output layer</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>the triple sum simply adds up the squares of all the individual $Θ_s$ in the entire network.</em></strong></li><li>the i in the triple sum does <strong>not</strong> refer to training example i .</li></ul><h2 id="Backpropagation-Algorithm"><a href="#Backpropagation-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Backpropagation Algorithm"></a>Backpropagation Algorithm</h2><p>“Backpropagation” is neural-network terminology for minimizing our cost function, just like what we were doing with gradient descent in logistic and linear regression. Our goal is to compute:<br>$$<br>\min_\Theta J(\Theta)<br>$$<br>That is, we want to minimize our cost function $J$ using an optimal set of parameters in theta. In this section we’ll look at the equations we use to compute the partial derivative of $J(Θ)$:<br>$$<br>\dfrac{\partial}{\partial \Theta_{i,j}^{(l)}}J(\Theta)<br>$$<br>To do so, we use the following algorithm:</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/09/2.png" alt="backpropagation_algorithm"></p><p><strong>Back propagation Algorithm</strong></p><p>Given training set $\lbrace (x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}) \cdots (x^{(m)}, y^{(m)})\rbrace$</p><p>Set $\Delta^{(l)}_{i,j}$ := 0 for all (l,i,j), (hence you end up having a matrix full of zeros)</p><p>For training example t =1 to m:</p><ol><li>Set $a^{(1)} := x^{(t)}$</li><li>Perform forward propagation to compute $a^{(l)}$ for l=2,3,…,L</li></ol><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/09/3.png" alt="forward_propagation"><br>3. Using $y^{(t)}$, compute $\delta^{(L)} = a^{(L)} - y^{(t)}$</p><p>Where L is our total number of layers and $a^{(L)}$ is the vector of outputs of the activation units for the last layer. So our “error values” for the last layer are simply the differences of our actual results in the last layer and the correct outputs in y. To get the delta values of the layers before the last layer, we can use an equation that steps us back from right to left :<br>4. Compute $\delta^{(L-1)}, \delta^{(L-2)},\dots,\delta^{(2)}$ using $\delta^{(l)} = ((\Theta^{(l)})^T \delta^{(l+1)})\ .<em>\ a^{(l)}\ .</em>\ (1 - a^{(l)})$</p><p>The delta values of layer l are calculated by multiplying the delta values in the next layer with the theta matrix of layer l. We then element-wise multiply that with a function called g’, or g-prime, which is the derivative of the activation function g evaluated with the input values given by $z^{(l)}$.</p><p>The g-prime derivative terms can also be written out as:</p><p>$$g’(z^{(l)}) = a^{(l)}\ .*\ (1 - a^{(l)})$$<br>5. $\Delta^{(l)}<em>{i,j} := \Delta^{(l)}</em>{i,j} + a_j^{(l)} \delta_i^{(l+1)}$ or with vectorization, $\Delta^{(l)} := \Delta^{(l)} + \delta^{(l+1)}(a^{(l)})^T$</p><p>Hence we update our new $\Delta$ matrix.</p><ul><li><p>$D^{(l)}<em>{i,j} := \dfrac{1}{m}\left(\Delta^{(l)}</em>{i,j} + \lambda\Theta^{(l)}_{i,j}\right)$, if j≠0.</p></li><li><p>$D^{(l)}<em>{i,j} := \dfrac{1}{m}\Delta^{(l)}</em>{i,j}$ If j=0</p><p>The capital-delta matrix D is used as an “accumulator” to add up our values as we go along and eventually compute our partial derivative. Thus we get $\frac \partial {\partial \Theta_{ij}^{(l)}} J(\Theta)$= $D_{ij}^{(l)}$</p></li></ul><h2 id="Backpropagation-Intuition"><a href="#Backpropagation-Intuition" class="headerlink" title="Backpropagation Intuition"></a>Backpropagation Intuition</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong> [4:39, the last term for the calculation for $z^3_1$ (three-color handwritten formula) should be $a^2_2$ instead of $a^2_1$. 6:08 - the equation for cost(i) is incorrect. The first term is missing parentheses for the log() function, and the second term should be $(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-h{_\theta}{(x^{(i)}}))$. 8:50 - $\delta^{(4)} = y - a^{(4)}$ is incorrect and should be $\delta^{(4)} = a^{(4)} - y$.]</p><p>Recall that the cost function for a neural network is:</p><p>$$\begin{gather<em>}J(\Theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{t=1}^m\sum_{k=1}^K \left[ y^{(t)}<em>k \ \log (h_\Theta (x^{(t)}))_k + (1 - y^{(t)}_k)\ \log (1 - h_\Theta(x^{(t)})_k)\right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum</em>{l=1}^{L-1} \sum_{i=1}^{s_l} \sum_{j=1}^{s_l+1} ( \Theta_{j,i}^{(l)})^2\end{gather</em>}$$</p><p>If we consider simple non-multiclass classification (k = 1) and disregard regularization, the cost is computed with:</p><p>$$cost(t) =y^{(t)} \ \log (h_\Theta (x^{(t)})) + (1 - y^{(t)})\ \log (1 - h_\Theta(x^{(t)}))$$</p><p>Intuitively, $\delta_j^{(l)}$ is the “error” for $a^{(l)}_j$ (unit j in layer l). More formally, the delta values are actually the derivative of the cost function:</p><p>$$\delta_j^{(l)} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z_j^{(l)}} cost(t)$$</p><p>Recall that our derivative is the slope of a line tangent to the cost function, so the steeper the slope the more incorrect we are. Let us consider the following neural network below and see how we could calculate some $\delta_j^{(l)}$:</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/09/4.png" alt="backward propagation intuition1"></p><p>In the image above, to calculate $\delta_2^{(2)}$, we multiply the weights $\Theta_{12}^{(2)}$ and $\Theta_{22}^{(2)}$ by their respective $\delta$ values found to the right of each edge. So we get $\delta_2^{(2)}$= $\Theta_{12}^{(2)}$<em>$\delta_1^{(3)}$+$\Theta_{22}^{(2)}$</em>$\delta_2^{(3)}$. To calculate every single possible $\delta_j^{(l)}$, we could start from the right of our diagram. We can think of our edges as our $\Theta_{ij}$. Going from right to left, to calculate the value of $\delta_j^{(l)}$, you can just take the over all sum of each weight times the $\delta$ it is coming from. Hence, another example would be $\delta_2^{(3)}$=$\Theta_{12}^{(3)}$*$\delta_1^{(4)}$.</p><h1 id="02-backpropagation-in-practice"><a href="#02-backpropagation-in-practice" class="headerlink" title="02_backpropagation-in-practice"></a>02_backpropagation-in-practice</h1><h2 id="Implementation-Note-Unrolling-Parameters"><a href="#Implementation-Note-Unrolling-Parameters" class="headerlink" title="Implementation Note: Unrolling Parameters"></a>Implementation Note: Unrolling Parameters</h2><p>With neural networks, we are working with sets of matrices:</p><p>$$\begin{align*} \Theta^{(1)}, \Theta^{(2)}, \Theta^{(3)}, \dots \newline D^{(1)}, D^{(2)}, D^{(3)}, \dots \end{align*}$$</p><p>In order to use optimizing functions such as “fminunc()”, we will want to “unroll” all the elements and put them into one long vector:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">thetaVector &#x3D; [ Theta1(:); Theta2(:); Theta3(:); ]</span><br><span class="line">deltaVector &#x3D; [ D1(:); D2(:); D3(:) ]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>If the dimensions of Theta1 is 10x11, Theta2 is 10x11 and Theta3 is 1x11, then we can get back our original matrices from the “unrolled” versions as follows:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Theta1 &#x3D; reshape(thetaVector(1:110),10,11)</span><br><span class="line">Theta2 &#x3D; reshape(thetaVector(111:220),10,11)</span><br><span class="line">Theta3 &#x3D; reshape(thetaVector(221:231),1,11)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To summarize:</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/09/5.png" alt="neural_network_learning_theta"></p><h2 id="Gradient-Checking"><a href="#Gradient-Checking" class="headerlink" title="Gradient Checking"></a>Gradient Checking</h2><p>Gradient checking will assure that our backpropagation works as intended. We can approximate the derivative of our cost function with:<br>$$<br>\dfrac{\partial}{\partial\Theta}J(\Theta) \approx \dfrac{J(\Theta + \epsilon) - J(\Theta - \epsilon)}{2\epsilon}<br>$$<br>With multiple theta matrices, we can approximate the derivative with respect to $Θ_j$ as follows:<br>$$<br>\dfrac{\partial}{\partial\Theta_j}J(\Theta) \approx \dfrac{J(\Theta_1, \dots, \Theta_j + \epsilon, \dots, \Theta_n) - J(\Theta_1, \dots, \Theta_j - \epsilon, \dots, \Theta_n)}{2\epsilon}<br>$$<br>A small value for ϵ (epsilon) such as $ϵ=10^{−4}$ , guarantees that the math works out properly. If the value for ϵ is too small, we can end up with numerical problems.</p><p>Hence, we are only adding or subtracting epsilon to the $Θ_j$ matrix. In octave we can do it as follows:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">epsilon &#x3D; 1e-4;</span><br><span class="line">for i &#x3D; 1:n,</span><br><span class="line">  thetaPlus &#x3D; theta;</span><br><span class="line">  thetaPlus(i) +&#x3D; epsilon;</span><br><span class="line">  thetaMinus &#x3D; theta;</span><br><span class="line">  thetaMinus(i) -&#x3D; epsilon;</span><br><span class="line">  gradApprox(i) &#x3D; (J(thetaPlus) - J(thetaMinus))&#x2F;(2*epsilon)</span><br><span class="line">end;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>We previously saw how to calculate the deltaVector.

The code to compute gradApprox can be very slow.</p><h2 id="Random-Initialization"><a href="#Random-Initialization" class="headerlink" title="Random Initialization"></a>Random Initialization</h2><p>Initializing all theta weights to zero does not work with neural networks. When we backpropagate, all nodes will update to the same value repeatedly.

          <h1 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h1><p>This personal note is written after studying the opening course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the coursera website</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning by Andrew NG</a> . And images, audios of this note all comes from the opening course.</p><h2 id="Motivations"><a href="#Motivations" class="headerlink" title="Motivations"></a>Motivations</h2><h3 id="non-linear-hypotheses"><a href="#non-linear-hypotheses" class="headerlink" title="non-linear-hypotheses"></a>non-linear-hypotheses</h3><p>In order to motivate the discussion of neural networks, let me start by showing you a few examples of machine learning problems where we need to learn complex non-linear hypotheses. Consider a supervised learning classification problem where you have a training set like this. If you want to apply logistic regression to this problem, one thing you could do is apply logistic regression with a lot of nonlinear features like that. So here, g as usual is the sigmoid function, and we can include lots of polynomial terms like these.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/1.png" alt=""></p><p>And, if you include enough polynomial terms then, you know, maybe you can get a hypotheses that separates the positive and negative examples.This particular method works well when you have only, say, two features - x1 and x2 because you can then include all those polynomial terms of x1 and x2.</p><h4 id="House-Prediction"><a href="#House-Prediction" class="headerlink" title="House Prediction"></a>House Prediction</h4><p>But for many interesting machine learning problems would have a lot more features than just two. We’ve been talking for a while about housing prediction, and suppose you have a housing classification problem rather than a regression problem, like maybe if you have different features of a house, and you want<br>to predict what are the odds that your house will be sold within the next six months, so that will be a classification problem. And as we saw we can come up with quite a lot of features, maybe a hundred different features of different houses.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/2.png" alt=""></p><p>For a problem like this, if you were to include all the quadratic terms, all of these, even all of the quadratic that is the second or the polynomial terms, there would be a lot of them. There would be terms like x1 squared, x1x2, x1x3, you know, x1x4 up to x1x100 and then you have x2 squared, x2x3 and so on. And if you include just the second order terms, that is, the terms that are a product of, you know, two of these terms, x1 times x1 and so on, then, for the case of n equals 100, you end up with about five thousand features. And, asymptotically, the number of quadratic features grows roughly as order n squared, where n is the number of the original features, like x1 through x100 that we had. And its actually closer to n squared over two. So including all the quadratic features doesn’t seem like it’s maybe a good idea, because that is a lot of features and you might up overfitting the training set, and it can also be computationally expensive, you know, to be working with that many features. One thing you could do is include only a subset of these, so if you include only the features x1 squared, x2 squared, x3 squared, up to maybe x100 squared, then the number of features is much smaller. Here you have only 100 such quadratic features, but this is not enough features and certainly won’t let you fit the data set like that on the upper left. In fact, if you include only these quadratic features together with the original x1, and so on, up to x100 features, then you can actually fit very interesting hypotheses. So, you can fit things like, you know, access a line of the ellipses like these, but you certainly cannot fit a more complex data set like that shown here. So 5000 features seems like a lot, if you were to include the cubic, or third order known of each others, the x1, x2, x3. You know, x1 squared, x2, x10 and x11, x17 and so on. You can imagine there are gonna be a lot of these features.</p><p>In fact, they are going to be order and cube such features and if any is 100 you can compute that, you end up with on the order of about 170,000 such cubic features and so including these higher auto-polynomial features when your original feature set end is large this really dramatically blows up your feature space and this doesn’t seem like a good way to come up with additional features with which to build none many classifiers when n is large.</p><h4 id="Car-recognition"><a href="#Car-recognition" class="headerlink" title="Car recognition"></a>Car recognition</h4><p><strong>For many machine learning problems, n will be pretty large</strong>. Here’s an example. Let’s consider the problem of computer vision. And suppose you want to use machine learning to train a classifier to examine an image and tell us whether or not the image is a car. Many people wonder why computer vision could be difficult. I mean when you and I look at this picture it is so obvious what this is. You wonder how is it that a learning algorithm could possibly fail to know what this picture is.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/3.png" alt=""></p><p>To understand why computer vision is hard let’s zoom into a small part of the image like that area where the little red rectangle is. It turns out that where you and I see a car, the computer sees that. What it sees is this matrix, or this grid, of pixel intensity values that tells us the brightness of each pixel in the image.So the computer vision problem is to look at this matrix of pixel intensity values, and tell us that these numbers represent the door handle of a car. Concretely, when we use machine learning to build a car detector, what we do is we come up with a label training set, with, let’s say, a few label examples of cars and a few label examples of things that are not cars, then we give our training set to the learning algorithm trained a classifier and then, you know, we may test it and show the new image and ask, “What is this new thing?”. And hopefully it will recognize that that is a car.</p><p>To understand why we need nonlinear hypotheses, let’s take a look at some of the images of cars and maybe non-cars that we might feed to our learning algorithm.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/4.png" alt=""></p><p>Let’s pick a couple of pixel locations in our images, so that’s pixel one location and pixel two location, and let’s plot this car, you know, at the location, at a certain point, depending on the intensities of pixel one and pixel two. And let’s do this with a few other images.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/5.png" alt=""></p><p>So let’s take a different example of the car and you know, look at the same two pixel locations and that image has a different intensity for pixel one and a different intensity for pixel two. So, it ends up at a different location on the figure. And then let’s plot some negative examples as well. That’s a non-car, that’s a non-car. And if we do this for more and more examples using the pluses(+) to denote cars and minuses(-) to denote non-cars, what we’ll find is that the cars and non-cars end up lying in different regions of the space, and what we need therefore is some sort of non-linear hypotheses to try to separate out the two classes.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/6.png" alt=""></p><p>What is the dimension of the feature space? Suppose we were to use just 50 by 50 pixel images. Now that suppose our images were pretty small ones, just 50 pixels on the side. Then we would have 2500 pixels, and so the dimension of our feature size will be N equals 2500 where our feature vector x is a list of all the pixel testings, you know, the pixel brightness of pixel one, the brightness of pixel two, and so on down to the pixel brightness of the last pixel where, you know, in a typical computer representation, each of these may be values between say 0 to 255 if it gives us the grayscale value. So we have n equals 2500, and that’s if we were using grayscale images. If we were using RGB images with separate red, green and blue values, we would have n equals 7500. So, if we were to try to learn a nonlinear hypothesis by including all the quadratic features, that is all the terms of the form, you know, $X_i$ times $X_j$, while with the 2500 pixels we would end up with a total of three million features. And that’s just too large to be reasonable; the computation would be very expensive to find and to represent all of these three million features per training example.</p><p>*<em>So, simple logistic regression together with adding in maybe the quadratic or the cubic features that’s just not a good way to learn complex nonlinear hypotheses when n is large because you just end up with too many features. *</em></p><p>In the next few videos, I would like to tell you about <strong>Neural Networks, which turns out to be a much better way to learn complex hypotheses, complex nonlinear hypotheses even when your input feature space, even when n is large.</strong> And along the way I’ll also get to show you a couple of fun videos of historically important applications of Neural networks as well that I hope those videos that we’ll see later will be fun for you to watch as well.</p><h3 id="neurons-and-the-brain"><a href="#neurons-and-the-brain" class="headerlink" title="neurons and the brain"></a>neurons and the brain</h3><p>Neural Networks are a pretty old algorithm that was originally motivated by the goal of having machines that can mimic the brain.</p><p>Now in this class, of course I’m teaching Neural Networks to you because they work really well for different machine learning problems and not, certainly not because they’re logically motivated. In this video, I’d like to give you some of the background on Neural Networks. So that we can get a sense of what we can expect them to do. Both in the sense of applying them to modern day machinery problems, as well as for those of you that might be interested in maybe the big AI dream of someday building truly intelligent machines. Also, how Neural Networks might pertain to that. <strong>The origins of Neural Networks was as algorithms that try to mimic the brain</strong> and those a sense that if we want to build learning systems while why not mimic perhaps the most amazing learning machine we know about, which is perhaps the brain.</p><p>Neural Networks came to be very widely used throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s and for various reasons as popularity diminished in the late 90’s. But more recently, Neural Networks have had a major recent resurgence. One of the reasons for this resurgence is that Neural Networks are computationally some what more expensive algorithm and so, it was only, you know, maybe somewhat more recently that computers became fast enough to really run large scale Neural Networks and because of that as well as a few other technical reasons which we’ll talk about later, modern Neural Networks today are the state of the art technique for many applications.</p><p>So, when you think about mimicking the brain while one of the human brain does tell me same things, right? The brain can learn to see process images than to hear, learn to process our sense of touch. We can, you know, learn to do math, learn to do calculus, and the brain does so many different and amazing things. It seems like if you want to mimic the brain it seems like you have to write lots of different pieces of software to mimic all of these different fascinating, amazing things that the brain tell us, but does is this fascinating hypothesis that the way the brain does all of these different things is not worth like a thousand different programs, but instead, the way the brain does it is worth just a single learning algorithm. This is just a hypothesis but let me share with you some of the evidence for this.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/7.png" alt=""></p><p>This part of the brain, that little red part of the brain, is your auditory cortex and the way you’re understanding my voice now is your ear is taking the sound signal and routing the sound signal to your auditory cortex and that’s what’s allowing you to understand my words. Neuroscientists have done the following fascinating experiments where you cut the wire from the ears to the auditory cortex and you re-wire, in this case an animal’s brain, so that the signal from the eyes to the optic nerve eventually gets routed to the auditory cortex. If you do this it turns out, the auditory cortex will learn to see. And this is in every single sense of the word see as we know it. So, if you do this to the animals, the animals can perform visual discrimination task and as they can look at images and make appropriate decisions based on the images and they’re doing it with that piece of brain tissue.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/8.png" alt=""></p><p>Here’s another example. That red piece of brain tissue is your somatosensory cortex. That’s how you process your sense of touch. If you do a similar re-wiring process then the somatosensory cortex will learn to see. Because of this and other similar experiments, these are called neuro-rewiring experiments. There’s this sense that if the same piece of physical brain tissue can process sight or sound or touch then maybe there is one learning algorithm that can process sight or sound or touch. And instead of needing to implement a thousand different programs or a thousand different algorithms to do, you know, the thousand wonderful things that the brain does, maybe what we need to do is figure out some approximation or to whatever the brain’s learning algorithm is and implement that and that the brain learned by itself how to process these different types of data. To a surprisingly large extent, it seems as if we can plug in almost any sensor to almost any part of the brain and so, within the reason, the brain will learn to deal with it.</p><h4 id="Sensor-representations-in-the-brain"><a href="#Sensor-representations-in-the-brain" class="headerlink" title="Sensor representations in the brain"></a>Sensor representations in the brain</h4><p>Here are a few more examples. On the upper left is an example of learning to see with your tongue. The way it works is–this is actually a system called BrainPort undergoing FDA trials now to help blind people see–but the way it works is, you strap a grayscale camera to your forehead, facing forward, that takes the low resolution grayscale image of what’s in front of you and you then run a wire to an array of electrodes that you place on your tongue so that each pixel gets mapped to a location on your tongue where maybe a high voltage corresponds to a dark pixel and a low voltage corresponds to a bright pixel and, even as it does today, with this sort of system you and I will be able to learn to see, you know, in tens of minutes with our tongues.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/9.png" alt=""></p><p>Here’s a second example of human echo location or human sonar. So there are two ways you can do this. You can either snap your fingers, or click your tongue. I can’t do that very well. But there are blind people today that are actually being trained in schools to do this and learn to interpret the pattern of sounds bouncing off your environment - that’s sonar. So, if after you search on YouTube, there are actually videos of this amazing kid who tragically because of cancer had his eyeballs removed, so this is a kid with no eyeballs. But by snapping his fingers, he can walk around and never hit anything. He can ride a skateboard. He can shoot a basketball into a hoop and this is a kid with no eyeballs.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/10.png" alt=""></p><p>Third example is the Haptic Belt where if you have a strap around your waist, ring up buzzers and always have the northmost one buzzing. You can give a human a direction sense similar to maybe how birds can, you know, sense where north is.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/11.png" alt=""></p><p>And, some of the bizarre example, but if you plug a third eye into a frog, the frog will learn to use that eye as well.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/12.png" alt=""></p><p><strong>So, it’s pretty amazing to what extent is as if you can plug in almost any sensor to the brain and the brain’s learning algorithm will just figure out how to learn from that data and deal with that data. And there’s a sense that if we can figure out what the brain’s learning algorithm is, and, you know, implement it or implement some approximation to that algorithm on a computer, maybe that would be our best shot at, you know, making real progress towards the AI, the artificial intelligence dream of someday building truly intelligent machines.</strong> Now, of course, I’m not teaching Neural Networks, you know, just because they might give us a window into this far-off AI dream, even though I’m personally, that’s one of the things that I personally work on in my research life. But the main reason I’m teaching Neural Networks in this class is because it’s actually a very effective state of the art technique for modern day machine learning applications. So, in the next few videos, we’ll start diving into the technical details of Neural Networks so that you can apply them to modern-day machine learning applications and get them to work well on problems. But for me, you know, one of the reasons the excite me is that maybe they give us this window into what we might do if we’re also thinking of what algorithms might someday be able to learn in a manner similar to humankind.</p><h2 id="neural-networks"><a href="#neural-networks" class="headerlink" title="neural-networks"></a>neural-networks</h2><h3 id="Model-Representation-I"><a href="#Model-Representation-I" class="headerlink" title="Model Representation I"></a>Model Representation I</h3><p>Let’s examine how we will represent a hypothesis function using neural networks. At a very simple level, neurons are basically computational units that take inputs (<strong>dendrites</strong>) as electrical inputs (called “spikes”) that are channeled to outputs (<strong>axons</strong>).</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/13.png" alt=""></p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/14.png" alt=""></p><p>In our model, our dendrites are like the input features $x_1⋯x_n​$, and the output is the result of our hypothesis function. In this model our $x_0​$ input node is sometimes called the “<strong>bias unit</strong>“. It is always equal to 1. In neural networks, we use the same logistic function as in classification, $\frac{1}{1+e^{−θ^Tx}}​$, yet we sometimes call it a sigmoid (logistic) <strong>activation</strong> function. In this situation, our “theta” parameters are sometimes called “weights”.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/15.png" alt="Neuron-model_Logistic-unit"></p><p>Visually, a simplistic representation looks like:<br>$$<br>\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \newline x_1 \ x_2 \ \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}\ \ \ \ \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow h_\theta(x)<br>$$<br>Our input nodes (layer 1), also known as the “<strong>input layer</strong>“, go into another node (layer 2), which finally outputs the hypothesis function, known as the “<strong>output layer</strong>“. We can have intermediate layers of nodes between the input and output layers called the “<strong>hidden layers</strong>“.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/16.png" alt=""></p><p>In this example, we label these intermediate or *”hidden” layer* nodes $a^{(2)}_0 ⋯ a^{(2)}_n$ and call them “<strong>activation units</strong>“.<br>$$</p>\begin{align*}& a_i^{(j)} = \text{"activation" of unit $i$ in layer $j$} \\ & \Theta^{(j)} = \text{matrix of weights controlling function mapping from layer $j$ to layer $j+1$}\end{align*}<p>$$<br>If we had one hidden layer, it would look like:<br>$$<br>\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \ x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \ a_2^{(2)} \ a_3^{(2)} \ \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow h_\theta(x)<br>$$<br>The values for each of the “activation” nodes is obtained as follows:<br>$$</p>\begin{align*} a_1^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_2^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{20}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{21}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{22}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{23}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_3^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{30}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{31}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{32}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{33}^{(1)}x_3) \\ h_\Theta(x) = a_1^{(3)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)}) \\ \end{align*}<p>$$<br>This is saying that we compute our activation nodes by using a $3×4​$ matrix of parameters. We apply each row of the parameters to our inputs to obtain the value for one activation node. Our hypothesis output is the logistic function applied to the sum of the values of our activation nodes, which have been multiplied by yet another parameter matrix $Θ^{(2)}​$ containing the weights for our second layer of nodes.</p><p>Each layer gets its own matrix of weights, $Θ^{(j)}$. The dimensions of these matrices of weights is determined as follows: If network has $s_j$ units in layer j and $s_{j+1}$ units in layer j+1, then $Θ^{(j)}$ will be of dimension $s_{j+1}×(s_j+1)$.If network has $s_j$ units in layer $j$ and $s_{j+1}$ units in layer j+1, then $Θ^(j)$ will be of dimension $s_{j+1}×(s_j+1)$. <strong><em>The +1 comes from the addition in $Θ^{(j)}$ of the “bias nodes,” $x_0$ and $Θ^{(j)}_0$. In other words the output nodes will not include the bias nodes while the inputs will.</em></strong> The following image summarizes our model representation:</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/17.png" alt=""></p><p>Example: If layer 1 has 2 input nodes and layer 2 has 4 activation nodes. Dimension of $Θ^{(1)}$ is going to be $4×3$ where $s_j=2$ and $s_j+1=4$ so $s_{j+1}×(sj+1)=4×3$ .</p><h3 id="Model-Representation-II"><a href="#Model-Representation-II" class="headerlink" title="Model Representation II"></a>Model Representation II</h3><p>To re-iterate, the following is an example of a neural network:<br>$$</p>\begin{align*} a_1^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_2^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{20}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{21}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{22}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{23}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_3^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{30}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{31}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{32}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{33}^{(1)}x_3) \\ h_\Theta(x) = a_1^{(3)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)}) \\ \end{align*}<p>$$<br>In this section we’ll do a vectorized implementation of the above functions. We’re going to define a new variable $z^{(j)}_k$ that encompasses the parameters inside our g function. In our previous example if we replaced by the variable z for all the parameters we would get:<br>$$</p>\begin{align*}a_1^{(2)} = g(z_1^{(2)}) \\ a_2^{(2)} = g(z_2^{(2)}) \\ a_3^{(2)} = g(z_3^{(2)}) \\ \end{align*}<p>$$<br>In other words, for layer j=2 and node k, the variable z will be:<br>$$<br>z_k^{(2)} = \Theta_{k,0}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{k,1}^{(1)}x_1 + \cdots + \Theta_{k,n}^{(1)}x_n<br>$$<br>The vector representation of $x$ and $z_j$ is :<br>$$</p>\begin{align*}x = \begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\\cdots \\ x_n\end{bmatrix}, z^{(j)} = \begin{bmatrix}z_1^{(j)} \\ z_2^{(j)} \\\cdots \\ z_n^{(j)}\end{bmatrix}\end{align*}<p>$$<br>Setting $x=a^{(1)}$, we can rewrite the equation as:<br>$$<br>z^{(j)} = \Theta^{(j-1)}a^{(j-1)}<br>$$<br>We are multiplying our matrix $Θ^{(j−1)}$ with dimensions $s_j×(n+1)$ (where $s_j$ is the number of our activation nodes) by our vector $a^{(j−1)}$ with height $(n+1)$. This gives us our vector $z(j)$ with height $s_j$. Now we can get a vector of our activation nodes for layer $j$ as follows:<br>$$<br>a^{(j)} = g(z^{(j)})<br>$$<br>Where our function g can be applied element-wise to our vector $z^{(j)}$.</p><p>We can then add a bias unit (equal to 1) to layer j after we have computed $a^{(j)}$. This will be element $a^{(j)}_0$ and will be equal to 1. To compute our final hypothesis, let’s first compute another $z$ vector:<br>$$<br>z^{(j+1)} = \Theta^{(j)}a^{(j)}<br>$$<br>We get this final $z$ vector by multiplying the next theta matrix after $Θ^{(j−1)}$ with the values of all the activation nodes we just got. This last theta matrix $Θ^{(j)}$ will have only <strong>one row</strong> which is multiplied by one column $a^{(j)}$ so that our result is a single number. We then get our final result with:<br>$$<br>h_\Theta(x) = a^{(j+1)} = g(z^{(j+1)})<br>$$<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/18.png" alt=""></p><p>Notice that in this <strong>last step</strong>, between layer j and layer j+1, we are doing <strong>exactly the same thing</strong> as we did in logistic regression. Adding all these intermediate layers in neural networks allows us to more elegantly produce interesting and more complex non-linear hypotheses.</p><h4 id="Neural-network-learning-its-own-features"><a href="#Neural-network-learning-its-own-features" class="headerlink" title="Neural network learning its own features"></a>Neural network learning its own features</h4><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/19.png" alt=""></p><p>let’s say I cover up the left path of this picture for now. If you look at what’s left in this picture. This looks a lot like logistic regression where what we’re doing is we’re using that note, that’s just the logistic regression unit and we’re using that to make a prediction h of x. And concretely, what the hypotheses is outputting is h of x is going to be equal to g which is my sigmoid activation function times theta 0 times a0 is equal to 1 plus theta 1 plus theta 2 times a2 plus theta 3 times a3 whether values a1, a2, a3 are those given by these three given units. Now, to be actually consistent to my early notation.</p><p>Actually, we need to, you know, fill in these superscript 2’s here everywhere and I also have these indices 1 there because I have only one output unit, but if you focus on the blue parts of the notation. This is, you know, this looks awfully like the standard logistic regression model, except that I now have a capital theta instead of lower case theta. And what this is doing is just logistic regression. But where the features fed into logistic regression are these values computed by the hidden layer. Just to say that again, what this neural network is doing is just like logistic regression, except that rather than using the original features x1, x2, x3, is using these new features a1, a2, a3. Again, we’ll put the superscripts there, you know, to be consistent with the notation. And the cool thing about this, is that the features a1, a2, a3, they themselves are learned as functions of the input. Concretely, the function mapping from layer 1 to layer 2, that is determined by some other set of parameters, theta 1. So it’s as if the neural network, instead of being constrained to feed the features x1, x2, x3 to logistic regression. It gets to learn its own features, a1, a2, a3, to feed into the logistic regression and as you can imagine depending on what parameters it chooses for theta 1.<br>You can learn some pretty interesting and complex features and therefore you can end up with a better hypotheses than if you were constrained to use the raw features x1, x2 or x3 or if you will constrain to say choose the polynomial terms, you know, x1, x2, x3, and so on. But instead, this algorithm has the flexibility to try to learn whatever features at once, using these a1, a2, a3 in order to feed into this last unit that’s essentially a logistic regression here.<br>I realized this example is described as a somewhat high level and so I’m not sure if this intuition of the neural network, you know, having more complex features will quite make sense yet, but if it doesn’t yet in the next two videos I’m going to go through a specific example of how a neural network can use this hidden there to compute more complex features to feed into this final output layer and how that can learn more complex hypotheses. So, in case what I’m saying here doesn’t quite make sense, stick with me for the next two videos and hopefully out there working through those examples this explanation will make a little bit more sense. But just the point O.</p><h4 id="Other-network-architectures"><a href="#Other-network-architectures" class="headerlink" title="Other network architectures"></a>Other network architectures</h4><p>You can have neural networks with other types of diagrams as well, and the way that neural networks are connected, that’s called the architecture. So the term architecture refers to how the different neurons are connected to each other. This is an example of a different neural network architecture and once again you may be able to get this intuition of how the second layer, here we have three heading units that are computing some complex function maybe of the input layer, and then the third layer can take the second layer’s features and compute even more complex features in layer three so that by the time you get to the output layer, layer four, you can have even more complex features of what you are able to compute in layer three and so get very interesting nonlinear hypotheses. By the way, in a network like this, layer one, this is called an input layer. Layer four is still our output layer, and this network has two hidden layers.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/20.png" alt=""></p><p>So anything that’s not an input layer or an output layer is called a hidden layer. So, hopefully from this video you’ve gotten a sense of how the feed forward propagation step in a neural network works where you start from the activations of the input layer and forward propagate that to the first hidden layer, then the second hidden layer, and then finally the output layer. And you also saw how we can vectorize that computation. In the next, I realized that some of the intuitions in this video of how, you know, other certain layers are computing complex features of the early layers. I realized some of that intuition may be still slightly abstract and kind of a high level. And so what I would like to do in the two videos is work through a detailed example of how a neural network can be used to compute nonlinear functions of the input and hope that will give you a good sense of the sorts of complex nonlinear hypotheses we can get out of Neural Networks.</p><h2 id="Applications"><a href="#Applications" class="headerlink" title="Applications"></a>Applications</h2><h3 id="Examples-and-Intuitions-I"><a href="#Examples-and-Intuitions-I" class="headerlink" title="Examples and Intuitions I"></a>Examples and Intuitions I</h3><p>A simple example of applying neural networks is by predicting x1 AND x2, which is the logical ‘and’ operator and is only true if both x1 and x2 are 1.</p><p>The graph of our functions will look like:<br>$$</p>\begin{align*}\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}g(z^{(2)})\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow h_\Theta(x)\end{align*}<p>$$<br>Remember that x0 is our bias variable and is always 1.</p><p>Let’s set our first theta matrix as:<br>$$<br>\Theta^{(1)} =\begin{bmatrix}-30 &amp; 20 &amp; 20\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>This will cause the output of our hypothesis to only be positive if both x1 and x2 are 1. In other words:<br>$$</p>\begin{align*}& h_\Theta(x) = g(-30 + 20x_1 + 20x_2) \\ \\ & x_1 = 0 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 0 \ \ then \ \ g(-30) \approx 0 \\ & x_1 = 0 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 1 \ \ then \ \ g(-10) \approx 0 \\ & x_1 = 1 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 0 \ \ then \ \ g(-10) \approx 0 \\ & x_1 = 1 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 1 \ \ then \ \ g(10) \approx 1\end{align*}<p>$$<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/21.png" alt=""></p><p>So we have constructed one of the fundamental operations in computers by using a small neural network rather than using an actual AND gate.</p><p>Neural networks can also be used to simulate all the other logical gates. The following is an example of the logical operator ‘OR’, meaning either x1 is true or x2 is true, or both:</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/22.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="Examples-and-Intuitions-II"><a href="#Examples-and-Intuitions-II" class="headerlink" title="Examples and Intuitions II"></a>Examples and Intuitions II</h3><p>The $Θ^{(1)}$ matrices for AND, NOR, and OR are :<br>$$</p>\begin{align*}AND:\\ \Theta^{(1)} &=\begin{bmatrix}-30 & 20 & 20\end{bmatrix} \\ NOR:\\ \Theta^{(1)} &= \begin{bmatrix}10 & -20 & -20\end{bmatrix} \\ OR:\\ \Theta^{(1)} &= \begin{bmatrix}-10 & 20 & 20\end{bmatrix} \\ \end{align*}<p>$$<br>We can combine these to get the XNOR logical operator (which gives 1 if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both 0 or both 1).<br>$$</p>\begin{align*}\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \\ a_2^{(2)} \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}a^{(3)}\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow h_\Theta(x)\end{align*}<p>$$<br>For the transition between the first and second layer, we’ll use a $Θ^{(1)}$ matrix that combines the values for AND and NOR:<br>$$<br>\Theta^{(1)} =\begin{bmatrix}-30 &amp; 20 &amp; 20 \ 10 &amp; -20 &amp; -20\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>For transition between the second and third layer, we’ll use a $Θ^{(2)}$ matrix that uses the value for OR:<br>$$<br>\Theta^{(2)} =\begin{bmatrix}-10 &amp; 20 &amp; 20\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>Let’s write out the values for all our nodes:<br>$$</p>\begin{align*}& a^{(2)} = g(\Theta^{(1)} \cdot x) \\ & a^{(3)} = g(\Theta^{(2)} \cdot a^{(2)}) \\ & h_\Theta(x) = a^{(3)}\end{align*}<p>$$<br>And there we have the XNOR operator using a hidden layer with two nodes! The following summarizes the above algorithm:</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/23.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="Multiclass-Classification"><a href="#Multiclass-Classification" class="headerlink" title="Multiclass Classification"></a>Multiclass Classification</h3><p>To classify data into multiple classes, we let our hypothesis function return a vector of values. Say we wanted to classify our data into one of four categories. We will use the following example to see how this classification is done. This algorithm takes as input an image and classifies it accordingly:</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/24.png" alt=""></p><p>We can define our set of resulting classes as y:<br>$$<br>y^{(i)}=\begin{bmatrix}1\0\0\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\1\0\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\0\1\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\0\0\1\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>Each $y^{(i)}$ represents a different image corresponding to either a car, pedestrian, truck, or motorcycle. The inner layers, each provide us with some new information which leads to our final hypothesis function. The setup looks like:<br>$$<br>\begin{bmatrix}x_0\x_1\x_2\ \cdots \ x_n\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}a_0^{(2)}\a_1^{(2)}\ \cdots \ a_n^{(2)}\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}a_0^{(3)}\a_1^{(3)}\ \cdots \ a_n^{(3)}\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}h_\Theta(x)_1\h_\Theta(x)_2\h_\Theta(x)_3\h_\Theta(x)_4\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>Our resulting hypothesis for one set of inputs may look like:<br>$$<br>h_\Theta(x) =\begin{bmatrix}0 \ 0 \ 1 \ 0 \ \end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>In which case our resulting class is the third one down, or $h_Θ(x)_3$, which represents the motorcycle.</p><h2 id="Word-Dict"><a href="#Word-Dict" class="headerlink" title="Word Dict"></a>Word Dict</h2><ol start="2"><li><p>pertain to : relate to 与 … 相关</p></li><li><p>cortex 皮层；皮质；(尤指)大脑皮层</p></li><li><p>optic<br>◙ adj.
