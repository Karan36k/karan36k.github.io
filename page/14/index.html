          <h1 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h1><p>This personal note is written after studying the opening course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the coursera website</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning by Andrew NG</a> . And images, audios of this note all comes from the opening course. </p>
<h2 id="Motivations"><a href="#Motivations" class="headerlink" title="Motivations"></a>Motivations</h2><h3 id="non-linear-hypotheses"><a href="#non-linear-hypotheses" class="headerlink" title="non-linear-hypotheses"></a>non-linear-hypotheses</h3><p>In order to motivate the discussion of neural networks, let me start by showing you a few examples of machine learning problems  where we need to learn complex non-linear hypotheses. Consider a supervised learning classification problem where you have a training set like this. If you want to apply logistic regression to this problem, one thing you could do is apply logistic regression with a lot of nonlinear features like that. So here, g as usual is the sigmoid function, and we can include lots of polynomial terms like these.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And, if you include enough polynomial terms then,  you know, maybe you can get a hypotheses that separates the positive and negative examples.This particular method works well when you have only, say,  two features - x1 and x2 because you can then include all those polynomial terms of x1 and x2. </p>
<h4 id="House-Prediction"><a href="#House-Prediction" class="headerlink" title="House Prediction"></a>House Prediction</h4><p>But for many interesting machine learning problems would have a lot more features than just two. We’ve been talking for a while about housing prediction, and suppose you have a housing classification problem rather than a regression problem, like maybe if you have different features of a house, and you want<br>to predict what are the odds that your house will be sold within the next six months, so that will be a classification problem. And as we saw we can come up with quite a lot of features, maybe a hundred different features of different houses. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For a problem like this, if you were to include all the quadratic terms, all of these, even all of the quadratic that is the second or the polynomial terms, there would be a lot of them. There would be terms like x1 squared, x1x2, x1x3, you know, x1x4 up to x1x100 and then you have x2 squared, x2x3 and so on. And if you include just the second order terms, that is, the terms that are a product of, you know,  two of these terms, x1 times x1 and so on, then, for the case of n equals 100, you end up with about five thousand features. And, asymptotically, the number of quadratic features grows roughly as order n squared, where n is the number of the original features, like x1 through x100 that we had. And its actually closer to n squared over two.  So including all the quadratic features doesn’t seem like it’s maybe a good idea, because that is a lot of features and you might up overfitting the training set, and it can also be computationally expensive, you know, to be working with that many features. One thing you could do is include only a subset of these, so if you include only the features x1 squared, x2 squared, x3 squared, up to maybe x100 squared, then the number of features is much smaller. Here you have only 100 such  quadratic features, but this is not enough features and certainly won’t let you fit the data set like that on the upper left. In fact, if you include only these quadratic features together with the original x1, and so on, up to x100 features, then you can actually fit very interesting hypotheses. So, you can fit things like, you know, access a line of the ellipses like these, but you certainly cannot fit a more complex data set like that shown here. So 5000 features seems like a lot, if you were to  include the cubic, or third order known of each others, the x1, x2, x3. You know, x1 squared, x2, x10 and x11, x17 and so on. You can imagine there are gonna be a lot of these features.</p>
<p>In fact, they are going to be order and cube such features and if any is 100 you can compute that, you end up with on the order of about 170,000 such cubic features and so including these higher auto-polynomial features when your original feature set end is large this really dramatically blows up your feature space and this doesn’t seem like a good way to come up with additional features with which to build none many classifiers when n is large. </p>
<h4 id="Car-recognition"><a href="#Car-recognition" class="headerlink" title="Car recognition"></a>Car recognition</h4><p><strong>For many machine learning problems, n will be pretty large</strong>.  Here’s an example. Let’s consider the problem of computer vision. And suppose you want to use machine learning to train a classifier to examine an image and tell us whether or not the image is a car. Many people wonder why computer vision could be difficult. I mean when you and I look at this picture it is so obvious what this is. You wonder how is it that a learning algorithm could possibly fail to know what this picture is.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To understand why computer vision is hard let’s zoom into a small part of the image like that area where the little red rectangle is. It turns out that where you and I see a car, the computer sees that. What it sees is this matrix, or this grid, of pixel intensity values that tells us the brightness of each pixel in the image.So the computer vision problem is to look at this matrix of pixel intensity values, and tell us that these numbers represent the door handle of a car. Concretely, when we use machine learning to build a car detector, what we do is we come up with a label training set, with, let’s say, a few label examples of cars and a few label examples of things that are not cars, then we give our training set to the learning algorithm trained a classifier and then, you know, we may test it and show the new image and ask, “What is this new thing?”. And hopefully it will recognize that that is a car.</p>
<p>To understand why we need nonlinear hypotheses, let’s take a look at some of the images of cars and maybe non-cars that we might feed to our learning algorithm. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s pick a couple of pixel locations in our images, so that’s pixel one location and pixel two location, and let’s plot this car, you know, at the location, at a certain point, depending on the intensities of pixel one and pixel two. And let’s do this with a few other images. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So let’s take a different example of  the car and you know, look at the same two pixel locations and that image has a different intensity for pixel one and a different intensity for pixel two. So, it ends up at a different location on the figure. And then let’s plot some negative examples as well. That’s a non-car, that’s a non-car. And if we do this for more and more examples using the pluses(+) to denote cars and minuses(-) to denote non-cars, what we’ll find is that the cars and non-cars end up lying in different regions of the space, and what we need therefore is some sort of non-linear hypotheses to try to separate out the two classes. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>What is the dimension of the feature space? Suppose we were to use just 50 by 50 pixel images. Now that suppose our images were pretty small ones, just 50 pixels on the side. Then we would have 2500 pixels, and so the dimension of our feature size will be N equals 2500 where our feature vector x is a list of all the pixel testings, you know,  the pixel brightness of pixel one, the brightness of pixel two, and so on down to the pixel brightness of the last pixel where, you know, in a typical  computer representation, each of these may be values between say 0 to 255 if it gives us the grayscale value. So we have n equals 2500, and that’s if we were using grayscale images. If we were using RGB images with separate red, green and blue values, we would have n equals 7500. So, if we were to try to learn a nonlinear hypothesis by including all the quadratic features, that is all the terms of the form, you know, $X_i$ times $X_j$, while with the 2500 pixels we would end up with a total of three million features. And that’s just too large to be reasonable; the computation would be very expensive to find and to represent all of these three million features per training example. </p>
<p>*<em>So, simple logistic regression together with adding in maybe the quadratic or the cubic features that’s just not a good way to learn complex nonlinear hypotheses when n is large because you just end up with too many features. *</em></p>
<p>In the next few videos, I would like to tell you about <strong>Neural Networks, which turns out to be a much better way to learn complex hypotheses, complex nonlinear hypotheses even when your input feature space, even when n is large.</strong> And along the way I’ll also get to show you a couple of fun videos of historically important applications of Neural networks as well that I hope those videos that we’ll see later will be fun for you to watch as well.</p>
<h3 id="neurons-and-the-brain"><a href="#neurons-and-the-brain" class="headerlink" title="neurons and the brain"></a>neurons and the brain</h3><p>Neural Networks are a pretty old algorithm that was originally motivated by the goal of having machines that can mimic the brain. </p>
<p>Now in this class, of course I’m teaching Neural Networks to you because they work really well for different machine learning problems and not, certainly not because they’re logically motivated. In this video, I’d like to give you some of the background on Neural Networks. So that we can get a sense of what we can expect them to do. Both in the sense of applying them to modern day machinery problems, as well as for those of you that might be interested in maybe the big AI dream of someday building truly intelligent machines. Also, how Neural Networks might pertain to that. <strong>The origins of Neural Networks was as algorithms that try to mimic the brain</strong> and those a sense that if we want to build learning systems while why not mimic perhaps the most amazing learning machine we know about, which is perhaps the brain. </p>
<p>Neural Networks came to be very widely used throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s and for various reasons as popularity diminished in the late 90’s. But more recently, Neural Networks  have had a major recent resurgence. One of the reasons for this resurgence is that Neural Networks are computationally some what more expensive algorithm and so, it was only, you know, maybe somewhat more recently that computers became fast enough to really run large scale Neural Networks and because of that as well as a few other technical reasons which we’ll talk about later, modern Neural Networks today are the state of the art technique for many applications.</p>
<p>So, when you think about mimicking the brain while one of the human brain does tell me same things, right? The brain can learn to see process images than to hear, learn to process our sense of touch. We can, you know, learn to do math, learn to do calculus, and the brain does so many different and amazing things. It seems like if you want to mimic the brain it seems like you have to write lots of different pieces of software to mimic all of these different fascinating, amazing things that the brain tell us, but does is this fascinating hypothesis that the way the brain does all of these different things is not worth like a thousand different programs, but instead, the way the brain does it is worth just a single learning algorithm. This is just a hypothesis but let me share with you some of the evidence for this.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This part of the brain, that little red part of the brain, is your auditory cortex and the way you’re understanding my voice now is your ear is taking the sound signal and routing the sound signal to your auditory cortex and that’s what’s allowing you to understand my words. Neuroscientists have done the following fascinating experiments where you cut the wire from the ears to the auditory cortex and you re-wire, in this case an animal’s brain, so that the signal from the eyes to the optic nerve eventually gets routed to the auditory cortex. If you do this it turns out, the auditory cortex will learn to see. And this is in every single sense of the word see as we know it. So, if you do this to the animals, the animals can perform visual discrimination task and as they can look at images and make appropriate decisions based on the images and they’re doing it with that piece of brain tissue. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here’s another example. That red piece of brain tissue is your somatosensory cortex. That’s how you process your sense of touch. If you do a similar re-wiring process then the somatosensory cortex will learn to see. Because of this and other similar experiments, these are called neuro-rewiring experiments. There’s this sense that if the same piece of physical brain tissue can process sight or sound or touch then maybe there is one learning algorithm that can process sight or sound or touch. And instead of needing to implement a thousand different programs or a thousand different algorithms to do, you know, the thousand wonderful things that the brain does, maybe what we need to do is figure out some approximation or to whatever the brain’s learning algorithm is and implement that and that the brain learned by itself how to process these different types of data. To a surprisingly large extent, it seems as if we can plug in almost any sensor to almost any part of the brain and so, within the reason, the brain will learn to deal with it.</p>
<h4 id="Sensor-representations-in-the-brain"><a href="#Sensor-representations-in-the-brain" class="headerlink" title="Sensor representations in the brain"></a>Sensor representations in the brain</h4><p>Here are a few more examples. On the upper left is an example of learning to see with your tongue. The way it works is–this is actually a system called BrainPort undergoing FDA trials now to help blind people see–but the way it works is, you strap a grayscale camera to your forehead, facing forward, that takes the low resolution grayscale image of what’s in front of you and you then run a wire to an array of electrodes that you place on your tongue so that each pixel gets mapped to a location on your tongue where maybe a high voltage corresponds to a dark pixel and a low voltage corresponds to a bright pixel and, even as it does today, with this sort of system you and I will be able to learn to see, you know, in tens of minutes with our tongues.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here’s a second example of human echo location or human sonar. So there are two ways you can do this. You can either snap your fingers, or click your tongue. I can’t do that very well. But there are blind people today that are actually being trained in schools to do this and learn to interpret the pattern of sounds bouncing off your environment - that’s sonar. So, if after you search on YouTube, there are actually videos of this amazing kid who tragically because of cancer had his eyeballs removed, so this is a kid with no eyeballs. But by snapping his fingers, he can walk around and never hit anything. He can ride a skateboard. He can shoot a basketball into a hoop and this is a kid with no eyeballs.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Third example is the Haptic Belt where if you have a strap around your waist, ring up buzzers and always have the northmost one buzzing. You can give a human a direction sense similar to maybe how birds can, you know, sense where north is.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And, some of the bizarre example, but if you plug a third eye into a frog, the frog will learn to use that eye as well. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/12.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>So, it’s pretty amazing to what extent is as if you can plug in almost any sensor to the brain and the brain’s learning algorithm will just figure out how to learn from that data and deal with that data. And there’s a sense that if we can figure out what the brain’s learning algorithm is, and, you know, implement it or implement some approximation to that algorithm on a computer, maybe that would be our best shot at, you know, making real progress towards the AI, the artificial intelligence dream of someday building truly intelligent machines.</strong> Now, of course, I’m not teaching Neural Networks, you know, just because they might give us a window into this far-off AI dream, even though I’m personally, that’s one of the things that I personally work on in my research life. But the main reason I’m teaching Neural Networks in this class is because it’s actually a very effective state of the art technique for modern day machine learning applications. So, in the next few videos, we’ll start diving into the technical details of Neural Networks so that you can apply them to modern-day machine learning applications and get them to work well on problems. But for me, you know, one of the reasons the excite me  is that maybe they give us this window into what we might do if we’re also thinking of what algorithms might someday be able to learn in a manner similar to humankind.</p>
<h2 id="neural-networks"><a href="#neural-networks" class="headerlink" title="neural-networks"></a>neural-networks</h2><h3 id="Model-Representation-I"><a href="#Model-Representation-I" class="headerlink" title="Model Representation I"></a>Model Representation I</h3><p>Let’s examine how we will represent a hypothesis function using neural networks. At a very simple level, neurons are basically computational units that take inputs (<strong>dendrites</strong>) as electrical inputs (called “spikes”) that are channeled to outputs (<strong>axons</strong>).</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/13.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In our model, our dendrites are like the input features $x_1⋯x_n​$, and the output is the result of our hypothesis function. In this model our $x_0​$ input node is sometimes called the “<strong>bias unit</strong>“. It is always equal to 1. In neural networks, we use the same logistic function as in classification,  $\frac{1}{1+e^{−θ^Tx}}​$, yet we sometimes call it a sigmoid (logistic) <strong>activation</strong> function. In this situation, our “theta” parameters are sometimes called “weights”.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/15.png" alt="Neuron-model_Logistic-unit"></p>
<p>Visually, a simplistic representation looks like:<br>$$<br>\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \newline x_1 \ x_2 \ \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}\ \ \ \ \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow h_\theta(x)<br>$$<br>Our input nodes (layer 1), also known as the “<strong>input layer</strong>“, go into another node (layer 2), which finally outputs the hypothesis function, known as the “<strong>output layer</strong>“. We can have intermediate layers of nodes between the input and output layers called the “<strong>hidden layers</strong>“. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/16.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example, we label these intermediate or *”hidden” layer* nodes $a^{(2)}_0 ⋯ a^{(2)}_n$ and call them “<strong>activation units</strong>“.<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& a_i^{(j)} = \text{"activation" of unit $i$ in layer $j$} \\ & \Theta^{(j)} = \text{matrix of weights controlling function mapping from layer $j$ to layer $j+1$}\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>If we had one hidden layer, it would look like:<br>$$<br>\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \ x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3\end{bmatrix}\rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \ a_2^{(2)} \ a_3^{(2)} \ \end{bmatrix}\rightarrow h_\theta(x)<br>$$<br>The values for each of the “activation” nodes is obtained as follows:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*} a_1^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_2^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{20}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{21}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{22}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{23}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_3^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{30}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{31}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{32}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{33}^{(1)}x_3) \\ h_\Theta(x) = a_1^{(3)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)}) \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>This is saying that we compute our activation nodes by using a $3×4​$ matrix of parameters. We apply each row of the parameters to our inputs to obtain the value for one activation node. Our hypothesis output is the logistic function applied to the sum of the values of our activation nodes, which have been multiplied by yet another parameter matrix $Θ^{(2)}​$ containing the weights for our second layer of nodes. </p>
<p>Each layer gets its own matrix of weights, $Θ^{(j)}$. The dimensions of these matrices of weights is determined as follows: If network has $s_j$ units in layer j and $s_{j+1}$ units in layer j+1, then $Θ^{(j)}$ will be of dimension $s_{j+1}×(s_j+1)$.If network has $s_j$ units in layer $j$ and $s_{j+1}$ units in layer j+1, then $Θ^(j)$ will be of dimension $s_{j+1}×(s_j+1)$. <strong><em>The +1 comes from the addition in $Θ^{(j)}$ of the “bias nodes,” $x_0$ and $Θ^{(j)}_0$. In other words the output nodes will not include the bias nodes while the inputs will.</em></strong>  The following image summarizes our model representation:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/17.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Example: If layer 1 has 2 input nodes and layer 2 has 4 activation nodes. Dimension of $Θ^{(1)}$ is going to be $4×3$ where $s_j=2$ and $s_j+1=4$ so $s_{j+1}×(sj+1)=4×3$ .</p>
<h3 id="Model-Representation-II"><a href="#Model-Representation-II" class="headerlink" title="Model Representation II"></a>Model Representation II</h3><p>To re-iterate, the following is an example of a neural network:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*} a_1^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_2^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{20}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{21}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{22}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{23}^{(1)}x_3) \\ a_3^{(2)} = g(\Theta_{30}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{31}^{(1)}x_1 + \Theta_{32}^{(1)}x_2 + \Theta_{33}^{(1)}x_3) \\ h_\Theta(x) = a_1^{(3)} = g(\Theta_{10}^{(2)}a_0^{(2)} + \Theta_{11}^{(2)}a_1^{(2)} + \Theta_{12}^{(2)}a_2^{(2)} + \Theta_{13}^{(2)}a_3^{(2)}) \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>In this section we’ll do a vectorized implementation of the above functions. We’re going to define a new variable $z^{(j)}_k$ that encompasses the parameters inside our g function. In our previous example if we replaced by the variable z for all the parameters we would get:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}a_1^{(2)} = g(z_1^{(2)}) \\ a_2^{(2)} = g(z_2^{(2)}) \\ a_3^{(2)} = g(z_3^{(2)}) \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>In other words, for layer j=2 and node k, the variable z will be:<br>$$<br>z_k^{(2)} = \Theta_{k,0}^{(1)}x_0 + \Theta_{k,1}^{(1)}x_1 + \cdots + \Theta_{k,n}^{(1)}x_n<br>$$<br>The vector representation of $x$ and $z_j$ is :<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}x = \begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\\cdots \\ x_n\end{bmatrix},  z^{(j)} = \begin{bmatrix}z_1^{(j)} \\ z_2^{(j)} \\\cdots \\ z_n^{(j)}\end{bmatrix}\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>Setting $x=a^{(1)}$, we can rewrite the equation as:<br>$$<br>z^{(j)} = \Theta^{(j-1)}a^{(j-1)}<br>$$<br>We are multiplying our matrix $Θ^{(j−1)}$ with dimensions $s_j×(n+1)$ (where $s_j$ is the number of our activation nodes) by our vector $a^{(j−1)}$ with height $(n+1)$. This gives us our vector $z(j)$ with height $s_j$. Now we can get a vector of our activation nodes for layer $j$ as follows:<br>$$<br>a^{(j)} = g(z^{(j)})<br>$$<br>Where our function g can be applied element-wise to our vector $z^{(j)}$. </p>
<p>We can then add a bias unit (equal to 1) to layer j after we have computed $a^{(j)}$. This will be element $a^{(j)}_0$ and will be equal to 1. To compute our final hypothesis, let’s first compute another $z$ vector:<br>$$<br>z^{(j+1)} = \Theta^{(j)}a^{(j)}<br>$$<br>We get this final $z$ vector by multiplying the next theta matrix after $Θ^{(j−1)}$ with the values of all the activation nodes we just got. This last theta matrix $Θ^{(j)}$ will have only <strong>one row</strong> which is multiplied by one column $a^{(j)}$ so that our result is a single number. We then get our final result with:<br>$$<br>h_\Theta(x) = a^{(j+1)} = g(z^{(j+1)})<br>$$<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/18.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that in this <strong>last step</strong>, between layer j and layer j+1, we are doing <strong>exactly the same thing</strong> as we did in logistic regression. Adding all these intermediate layers in neural networks allows us to more elegantly produce interesting and more complex non-linear hypotheses.</p>
<h4 id="Neural-network-learning-its-own-features"><a href="#Neural-network-learning-its-own-features" class="headerlink" title="Neural network learning its own features"></a>Neural network learning its own features</h4><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/19.png" alt=""></p>
<p>let’s say I cover up the left path of this picture for now. If you look at what’s left in this picture. This looks a lot like logistic regression where what we’re doing is we’re using that note, that’s just the logistic regression unit and we’re using that to make a prediction h of x. And concretely, what the hypotheses is outputting is h of x is going to be equal to g which is my sigmoid activation function times theta 0 times a0 is equal to 1 plus theta 1 plus theta 2 times a2 plus theta 3 times a3 whether values a1, a2, a3 are those given by these three given units. Now, to be actually consistent to my early notation.</p>
<p>Actually, we need to, you know, fill in these superscript 2’s here everywhere and I also have these indices 1 there because I have only one output unit, but if you focus on the blue parts of the notation. This is, you know, this looks awfully like the standard logistic regression model, except that I now have a capital theta instead of lower case theta. And what this is doing is just logistic regression. But where the features fed into logistic regression are these values computed by the hidden layer. Just to say that again, what this neural network is doing is just like logistic regression, except that rather than using the original features x1, x2, x3, is using these new features a1, a2, a3. Again, we’ll put the superscripts there, you know, to be consistent with the notation. And the cool thing about this, is that the features a1, a2, a3, they themselves are learned as functions of the input. Concretely, the function mapping from layer 1 to layer 2, that is determined by some other set of parameters, theta 1. So it’s as if the neural network, instead of being constrained to feed the features x1, x2, x3 to logistic regression. It gets to learn its own features, a1, a2, a3, to feed into the logistic regression and as you can imagine depending on what parameters it chooses for theta 1.<br>You can learn some pretty interesting and complex features and therefore you can end up with a better hypotheses than if you were constrained to use the raw features x1, x2 or x3 or if you will constrain to say choose the polynomial terms, you know, x1, x2, x3, and so on. But instead, this algorithm has the flexibility to try to learn whatever features at once, using these a1, a2, a3 in order to feed into this last unit that’s essentially a logistic regression here.<br>I realized this example is described as a somewhat high level and so I’m not sure if this intuition of the neural network, you know, having more complex features will quite make sense yet, but if it doesn’t yet in the next two videos I’m going to go through a specific example of how a neural network can use this hidden there to compute more complex features to feed into this final output layer and how that can learn more complex hypotheses. So, in case what I’m saying here doesn’t quite make sense, stick with me for the next two videos and hopefully out there working through those examples this explanation will make a little bit more sense. But just the point O. </p>
<h4 id="Other-network-architectures"><a href="#Other-network-architectures" class="headerlink" title="Other network architectures"></a>Other network architectures</h4><p>You can have neural networks with other types of diagrams as well, and the way that neural networks are connected, that’s called the architecture. So the term architecture refers to how the different neurons are connected to each other. This is an example of a different neural network architecture and once again you may be able to get this intuition of how the second layer, here we have three heading units that are computing some complex function maybe of the input layer, and then the third layer can take the second layer’s features and compute even more complex features in layer three so that by the time you get to the output layer, layer four, you can have even more complex features of what you are able to compute in layer three and so get very interesting nonlinear hypotheses. By the way, in a network like this, layer one, this is called an input layer. Layer four is still our output layer, and this network has two hidden layers.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So anything that’s not an input layer or an output layer is called a hidden layer. So, hopefully from this video you’ve gotten a sense of how the feed forward propagation step in a neural network works where you start from the activations of the input layer and forward propagate that to the first hidden layer, then the second hidden layer, and then finally the output layer. And you also saw how we can vectorize that computation. In the next, I realized that some of the intuitions in this video of how, you know, other certain layers are computing complex features of the early layers. I realized some of that intuition may be still slightly abstract and kind of a high level. And so what I would like to do in the two videos is work through a detailed example of how a neural network can be used to compute nonlinear functions of the input and hope that will give you a good sense of the sorts of complex nonlinear hypotheses we can get out of Neural Networks.</p>
<h2 id="Applications"><a href="#Applications" class="headerlink" title="Applications"></a>Applications</h2><h3 id="Examples-and-Intuitions-I"><a href="#Examples-and-Intuitions-I" class="headerlink" title="Examples and Intuitions I"></a>Examples and Intuitions I</h3><p>A simple example of applying neural networks is by predicting x1 AND x2, which is the logical ‘and’ operator and is only true if both x1 and x2 are 1. </p>
<p>The graph of our functions will look like:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}g(z^{(2)})\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow h_\Theta(x)\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>Remember that x0 is our bias variable and is always 1. </p>
<p>Let’s set our first theta matrix as:<br>$$<br>\Theta^{(1)} =\begin{bmatrix}-30 &amp; 20 &amp; 20\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>This will cause the output of our hypothesis to only be positive if both x1 and x2 are 1. In other words:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& h_\Theta(x) = g(-30 + 20x_1 + 20x_2) \\ \\ & x_1 = 0 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 0 \ \ then \ \ g(-30) \approx 0 \\ & x_1 = 0 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 1 \ \ then \ \ g(-10) \approx 0 \\ & x_1 = 1 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 0 \ \ then \ \ g(-10) \approx 0 \\ & x_1 = 1 \ \ and \ \ x_2 = 1 \ \ then \ \ g(10) \approx 1\end{align*}
<p>$$<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/21.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So we have constructed one of the fundamental operations in computers by using a small neural network rather than using an actual AND gate. </p>
<p>Neural networks can also be used to simulate all the other logical gates. The following is an example of the logical operator ‘OR’, meaning either x1 is true or x2 is true, or both:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/22.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Examples-and-Intuitions-II"><a href="#Examples-and-Intuitions-II" class="headerlink" title="Examples and Intuitions II"></a>Examples and Intuitions II</h3><p>The $Θ^{(1)}$ matrices for AND, NOR, and OR are :<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}AND:\\ \Theta^{(1)} &=\begin{bmatrix}-30 & 20 & 20\end{bmatrix} \\ NOR:\\ \Theta^{(1)} &= \begin{bmatrix}10 & -20 & -20\end{bmatrix} \\ OR:\\ \Theta^{(1)} &= \begin{bmatrix}-10 & 20 & 20\end{bmatrix} \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>We can combine these to get the XNOR logical operator (which gives 1 if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are both 0 or both 1).<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \\ a_2^{(2)} \end{bmatrix} \rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}a^{(3)}\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow h_\Theta(x)\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>For the transition between the first and second layer, we’ll use a $Θ^{(1)}$ matrix that combines the values for AND and NOR:<br>$$<br>\Theta^{(1)} =\begin{bmatrix}-30 &amp; 20 &amp; 20 \ 10 &amp; -20 &amp; -20\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>For transition between the second and third layer, we’ll use a $Θ^{(2)}$ matrix that uses the value for OR:<br>$$<br>\Theta^{(2)} =\begin{bmatrix}-10 &amp; 20 &amp; 20\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>Let’s write out the values for all our nodes:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& a^{(2)} = g(\Theta^{(1)} \cdot x) \\ & a^{(3)} = g(\Theta^{(2)} \cdot a^{(2)}) \\ & h_\Theta(x) = a^{(3)}\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>And there we have the XNOR operator using a hidden layer with two nodes! The following summarizes the above algorithm:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/23.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Multiclass-Classification"><a href="#Multiclass-Classification" class="headerlink" title="Multiclass Classification"></a>Multiclass Classification</h3><p>To classify data into multiple classes, we let our hypothesis function return a vector of values. Say we wanted to classify our data into one of four categories. We will use the following example to see how this classification is done. This algorithm takes as input an image and classifies it accordingly:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/08/24.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can define our set of resulting classes as y:<br>$$<br>y^{(i)}=\begin{bmatrix}1\0\0\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\1\0\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\0\1\0\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}0\0\0\1\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>Each $y^{(i)}$ represents a different image corresponding to either a car, pedestrian, truck, or motorcycle. The inner layers, each provide us with some new information which leads to our final hypothesis function. The setup looks like:<br>$$<br>\begin{bmatrix}x_0\x_1\x_2\ \cdots \ x_n\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}a_0^{(2)}\a_1^{(2)}\ \cdots \ a_n^{(2)}\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}a_0^{(3)}\a_1^{(3)}\ \cdots \ a_n^{(3)}\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}h_\Theta(x)_1\h_\Theta(x)_2\h_\Theta(x)_3\h_\Theta(x)_4\end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>Our resulting hypothesis for one set of inputs may look like:<br>$$<br>h_\Theta(x) =\begin{bmatrix}0 \ 0 \ 1 \ 0 \ \end{bmatrix}<br>$$<br>In which case our resulting class is the third one down, or $h_Θ(x)_3$, which represents the motorcycle.</p>

          <h2 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h2><p>This personal note is written after studying the opening course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the coursera website</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning by Andrew NG</a> . And images, audios of this note all comes from the opening course. </p>
<h2 id="The-Problem-of-Overfitting"><a href="#The-Problem-of-Overfitting" class="headerlink" title="The Problem of Overfitting"></a>The Problem of Overfitting</h2><p>Consider the problem of predicting $y$ from $x ∈ R$. The leftmost figure below shows the result of fitting a $y = θ_0+θ_1x$ to a dataset. We see that the data doesn’t really lie on straight line, and so the fit is not very good.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/07/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead, if we had added an extra feature $x_2$ , and fit $y=θ<em>0+θ_1x+θ_2x^2$ , then we obtain a slightly better fit to the data (See middle figure). Naively, it might seem that the more features we add, the better. However, there is also a danger in adding too many features: The rightmost figure is the result of fitting a $5^{th}$ order polynomial $y=\sum</em>{j=0}^{5}\theta_jx^j$ . We see that even though the fitted curve passes through the data perfectly, we would not expect this to be a very good predictor of, say, housing prices (y) for different living areas(x). Without formally defining what these terms mean, we’ll say the figure on the left shows an instance of  <strong>underfitting</strong> —in which the data clearly shows structure not captured by the model—and the figure on the right is an example of *<em>overfitting *</em>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/07/2.png" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Underfitting, or high bias</strong>, <em>is when the form of our hypothesis function h maps poorly to the trend of the data. It is usually caused by a function that is too simple or uses too few features.</em></li>
<li>At the other extreme, <strong>overfitting, or high variance</strong>, <em>is caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but does not generalize well to predict new data. It is usually caused by a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves and angles unrelated to the data.</em> </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>This terminology is applied to both linear and logistic regression. There are two main options to address the issue of overfitting:</strong> </p>
<p>1) Reduce the number of features: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>​    Manually select which features to keep.   </p>
</li>
<li><p>​    Use a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course, such as PCA).   </p>
<p>2) Regularization </p>
</li>
<li><p>​    Keep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters $θ_j$.   </p>
</li>
<li><p>​    Regularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Cost-Function"><a href="#Cost-Function" class="headerlink" title="Cost Function"></a>Cost Function</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong>    [5:18 - There is a typo. It should be $\sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta <em>j ^2$ instead of $\sum</em>{i=1}^{n} \theta _j ^2$]</p>
<p>If we have overfitting from our hypothesis function, we can reduce the weight that some of the terms in our function carry by increasing their cost. </p>
<p>Say we wanted to make the following function more quadratic:<br>$$<br>\theta_0 + \theta_1x + \theta_2x^2 + \theta_3x^3 + \theta_4x^4<br>$$<br>We’ll want to eliminate the influence of $θ_3x_3$ and $θ_4x_4$ . Without actually getting rid of these features or changing the form of our hypothesis, we can instead modify our</p>
<p><strong>cost function</strong> :<br>$$<br>min_\theta\ \dfrac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 + 1000\cdot\theta_3^2 + 1000\cdot\theta_4^2<br>$$<br>We’ve added two extra terms at the end to inflate the cost of $θ_3$ and $θ_4$. Now, in order for the cost function to get close to zero, we will have to reduce the values of $θ_3$ and $θ_4$ to near zero. This will in turn greatly reduce the values of $θ_3x_3$ and $θ_4x_4$ in our hypothesis function. As a result, we see that the new hypothesis (depicted by the pink curve) looks like a quadratic function but fits the data better due to the extra small terms $θ_3x_3$ and $θ_4x_4$.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/07/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We could also regularize all of our theta parameters in a single summation as:<br>$$<br>min_\theta\ \dfrac{1}{2m}\  \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2 + \lambda\ \sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2<br>$$<br>The λ, or lambda, is the  <strong>regularization parameter</strong> . It determines how much the costs of our theta parameters are inflated. </p>
<p>Using the above cost function with the extra summation, we can smooth the output of our hypothesis function to reduce overfitting. If lambda is chosen to be too large, it may smooth out the function too much and cause underfitting. Hence, what would happen if λ=0 or is too small ?</p>

<h2 id="Regularized-Linear-Regression"><a href="#Regularized-Linear-Regression" class="headerlink" title="Regularized Linear Regression"></a>Regularized Linear Regression</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong>    [8:43 - It is said that X is non-invertible if m ≤ n. The correct statement should be that X is non-invertible if m &lt; n, and may be non-invertible if m = n. </p>
<p>We can apply regularization to both linear regression and logistic regression. We will approach linear regression first.<br>$$<br>J(\theta)=\frac{1}{2m} \left[  \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}\left(h_\theta(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)}\right)^2 + \lambda\sum_{j=1}^{n}\theta_j^2 \right]<br>$$</p>
<h3 id="Gradient-Descent"><a href="#Gradient-Descent" class="headerlink" title="Gradient Descent"></a>Gradient Descent</h3><p>We will modify our gradient descent function to separate out θ0θ0 from the rest of the parameters because we do not want to penalize<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*} & \text{Repeat}\ \lbrace \\ & \ \ \ \ \theta_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha\ \frac{1}{m}\ \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_0^{(i)} \\ & \ \ \ \ \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha\ \left[ \left( \frac{1}{m}\ \sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} \right) + \frac{\lambda}{m}\theta_j \right] &\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ j \in \lbrace 1,2...n\rbrace\\ & \rbrace \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>The term $\frac{λ}{m} θ<em>j$ performs our regularization. With some manipulation our update rule can also be represented as:<br>$$<br>\theta_j := \theta_j(1 - \alpha\frac{\lambda}{m}) - \alpha\frac{1}{m}\sum</em>{i=1}^m(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)}<br>$$<br>The first term in the above equation, $1−α\frac{λ}{m}$ will always be less than 1. Intuitively you can see it as reducing the value of $θ_j$ by some amount on every update. Notice that the second term is now exactly the same as it was before.</p>
<h3 id="Normal-Equation"><a href="#Normal-Equation" class="headerlink" title="Normal Equation"></a>Normal Equation</h3><p>Now let’s approach regularization using the alternate method of the non-iterative normal equation. </p>
<p>To add in regularization, the equation is the same as our original, except that we add another term inside the parentheses:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& \theta = \left( X^TX + \lambda \cdot L \right)^{-1} X^Ty \\ & \text{where}\ \ L = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & & & & \\ & 1 & & & \\ & & 1 & & \\ & & & \ddots & \\ & & & & 1 \\\end{bmatrix}\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>L is a matrix with 0 at the top left and 1’s down the diagonal, with 0’s everywhere else. It should have dimension (n+1)×(n+1). Intuitively, this is the identity matrix (though we are not including $x_0$), multiplied with a single real number λ. </p>
<p>Recall that <strong>if m &lt; n, then $X^TX$ is non-invertible. However, when we add the term λ⋅L, then $X^TX + λ⋅L$ becomes invertible.(Note: which is proved)</strong></p>
<h2 id="Regularized-Logistic-Regression"><a href="#Regularized-Logistic-Regression" class="headerlink" title="Regularized Logistic Regression"></a>Regularized Logistic Regression</h2><p>We can regularize logistic regression in a similar way that we regularize linear regression. As a result, we can avoid overfitting. The following image shows how the regularized function, displayed by the pink line, is less likely to overfit than the non-regularized function represented by the blue line:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/07/5.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="Cost-Function-1"><a href="#Cost-Function-1" class="headerlink" title="Cost Function"></a>Cost Function</h3><p>Recall that our cost function for logistic regression was:<br>$$<br>J(\theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \large[ y^{(i)}\ \log (h_\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\ \log (1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)})) \large]<br>$$<br>We can regularize this equation by adding a term to the end:<br>$$<br>J(\theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \large[ y^{(i)}\ \log (h_\theta (x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\ \log (1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))\large] + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^n \theta_j^2<br>$$<br>The second sum, $∑_n^{j=1}θ^2_j$ <strong>means to explicitly exclude</strong> the bias term, $θ_0$. I.e. the θ vector is indexed from 0 to n (holding n+1 values, $θ_0$ through $θ_n$), and this sum explicitly skips $θ_0$, by running from 1 to n, skipping 0. Thus, when computing the equation, we should continuously update the two following equations:</p>

<h3 id="Advanced-optimization"><a href="#Advanced-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Advanced optimization"></a>Advanced optimization</h3><p>Let’s talk about how to get regularized linear regression to work using the more advanced optimization methods. And just to remind you for those methods what we needed to do was to define the function that’s called the cost function, that takes us input the parameter vector theta and once again in the equations we’ve been writing here we used 0 index vectors. So we had theta 0 up to theta N. But because Octave indexes the vectors starting from 1. Theta 0 is written in Octave as theta 1. Theta 1 is written in Octave as theta 2, and so on down to theta N plus 1. And what we needed to do was provide a function. Let’s provide a function called cost function that we would then pass in to what we have, what we saw earlier. We will use the <code>fminunc</code> and then you know at cost function, and so on, right. But the <code>fminunc</code> was function minimization unconstrained in Octave and this will work with <code>fminunc</code> was what will take the cost function and minimize it for us. So the two main things that the cost function needed to return were first J-val. And for that, we need to write code to compute the <code>costfunction</code> J of theta. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/07/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, when we’re using regularized logistic regression, of course the <code>costfunction</code> J of theta changes and, in particular, now a cost function needs to include this additional regularization term at the end as well. So, when you compute j of theta be sure to include that term at the end. </p>
<p>And then, the other thing that this cost function thing needs to derive with a gradient. So gradient one needs to be set to the partial derivative of J of theta with respect to theta zero, gradient two needs to be set to that, and so on. Once again, the index is off by one. Right, because of the indexing from one Octave users. And looking at these terms. This term over here. We actually worked this out on a previous slide is actually equal to this. It doesn’t change. Because the derivative for theta zero doesn’t change. Compared to the version without regularization. And the other terms do change. And in particular the derivative respect to theta one. We worked this out on the previous slide as well. Is equal to, you know, the original term and then minus londer M times theta 1. Just so we make sure we pass this correctly. And we can add parentheses here. Right, so the summation doesn’t extend. And similarly, you know, this other term here looks like this, with this additional term that we had on the previous slide, that corresponds to the gradient from their regularization objective. So if you implement this cost function and pass this into <code>fminunc</code> or to one of those advanced optimization techniques, that will minimize the new regularized cost function J of theta. And the parameters you get out will be the ones that correspond to logistic regression with regularization. </p>
<p>So, now you know how to implement regularized logistic regression. When I walk around Silicon Valley, I live here in Silicon Valley, there are a lot of engineers that are frankly, making a ton of money for their companies using machine learning algorithms. And I know we’ve only been, you know, studying this stuff for a little while. But if you understand linear regression, the advanced optimization algorithms and regularization, by now, frankly, you probably know quite a lot more machine learning than many, certainly now, but you probably know quite a lot more machine learning right now than frankly, many of the Silicon Valley engineers out there having very successful careers. You know, making tons of money for the companies. Or building products using machine learning algorithms. So, congratulations. You’ve actually come a long ways. And you can actually, you actually know enough to apply this stuff and get to work for many problems. So congratulations for that. But of course, there’s still a lot more that we want to teach you, and in the next set of videos after this, we’ll start to talk about a very powerful cause of non-linear classifier. So whereas linear regression, logistic regression, you know, you can form polynomial terms, but it turns out that there are much more powerful nonlinear quantifiers that can then sort of polynomial regression. And in the next set of videos after this one, I’ll start telling you about them. So that you have even more powerful learning algorithms than you have now to apply to different problems.</p>

          <h2 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h2><p>This personal note is written after studying the opening course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the coursera website</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning by Andrew NG</a> .

<h2 id="Classification"><a href="#Classification" class="headerlink" title="Classification"></a>Classification</h2><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/1.png" alt=""><br>To attempt classification, one method is to use linear regression and map all predictions greater than 0.5 as a 1 and all less than 0.5 as a 0. However, this method doesn’t work well because classification is not actually a linear function. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The classification problem is just like the regression problem, except that the values we now want to predict take on only a small number of discrete values. For now, we will focus on the <strong>binary classification problem</strong> in which $y$ can take on only two values, 0 and 1. (Most of what we say here will also generalize to the multiple-class case.) For instance, if we are trying to build a spam classifier for email, then $x^{(i)}$ may be some features of a piece of email, and $y$ may be 1 if it is a piece of spam mail, and 0 otherwise. Hence, $y∈{0,1}$ . 0 is also called the negative class, and 1 the positive class, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols “-” and “+” . Given $x^{(i)}$, the corresponding $y^{(i)}$ is also called the label for the training example.</p>
<h2 id="Hypothesis-Representation"><a href="#Hypothesis-Representation" class="headerlink" title="Hypothesis Representation"></a>Hypothesis Representation</h2><p>We could approach the classification problem ignoring the fact that $y$ is discrete-valued, and use our old linear regression algorithm to try to predict $y$ given $x$. However, it is easy to construct examples where this method performs very poorly. Intuitively, it also doesn’t make sense for $h_{θ}(x)$ to take values larger than 1 or smaller than $0$ when we know that $y ∈ {0, 1}$. To fix this, let’s change the form for our hypotheses $h_{θ}(x)$ to satisfy $0≤h_{θ}(x)≤1$. This is accomplished by plugging $θ^Tx$ into the <strong>Logistic Function</strong> . </p>
<p>Our new form uses the <strong>“Sigmoid Function”</strong> , also called the <strong>“Logistic Function”</strong> :<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& h_\theta (x) = g ( \theta^T x ) \\ \\& z = \theta^T x \\& g(z) = \dfrac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>Using python to implement it :</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> numpy <span class="keyword">as</span> np;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">sigmoid</span><span class="params">(z)</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">   <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="number">1</span> / (<span class="number">1</span> + np.exp(-z))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The following image shows us what the sigmoid function looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>The function $g(z)$ , shown here, maps any real number to the $(0, 1)$ interval, making it useful for transforming an arbitrary-valued function into a function better suited for classification</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>$h_{θ}(x)$ will give us the probability that our output is 1</strong>. For example, $h_{θ}(x)=0.7$ gives us a probability of $70%$ that our output is 1. Our probability that our prediction is 0 is just the complement of our probability that it is 1 (e.g. if probability that it is 1 is $70%$, then the probability that it is 0 is $30%$).<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& h_\theta(x) = P(y=1 | x ; \theta) = 1 - P(y=0 | x ; \theta) \\ & P(y = 0 | x;\theta) + P(y = 1 | x ; \theta) = 1\end{align*}
<p>$$</p>
<h2 id="Decision-Boundary"><a href="#Decision-Boundary" class="headerlink" title="Decision Boundary"></a>Decision Boundary</h2><p>In order to get our discrete 0 or 1 classification, we can translate the output of the hypothesis function as follows:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& h_\theta(x) \geq 0.5 \rightarrow y = 1 \\ & h_\theta(x) < 0.5 \rightarrow y = 0 \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>The way our logistic function g behaves is that when its input is greater than or equal to zero, its output is greater than or equal to 0.5:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& g(z) \geq 0.5 \\ & when \; z \geq 0\end{align*}
<p>$$<br>From these statements we can now say:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& \theta^T x \geq 0 \Rightarrow y = 1 \\ & \theta^T x < 0 \Rightarrow y = 0 \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>The <strong>decision boundary</strong>  is the line that separates the area where y = 0 and where y = 1. It is created by our hypothesis function. </p>
<p><strong>Example</strong> :<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& \theta = \begin{bmatrix}5 \\ -1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \\ & y = 1 \; if \; 5 + (-1) x_1 + 0 x_2 \geq 0 \\ & 5 - x_1 \geq 0 \\ & - x_1 \geq -5 \\& x_1 \leq 5 \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>In this case, our decision boundary is a straight vertical line placed on the graph where $x_1=5$ , and everything to the left of that denotes $y = 1$ , while everything to the right denotes $y = 0$ . </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Again, the input to the sigmoid function g(z) (e.g. $θ^TX$ ) doesn’t need to be linear, and could be a function that describes a circle (e.g.  $z=θ_0+θ_1x^2_1+θ_2x^2_2$ ) or any shape to fit our data.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/5.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="Cost-Function"><a href="#Cost-Function" class="headerlink" title="Cost Function"></a>Cost Function</h2><p>We cannot use the same cost function that we use for linear regression because the Logistic Function will cause the output to be wavy, causing many local optima. In other words, it will not be a convex function. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead, our cost function for logistic regression looks like:<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& J(\theta) = \dfrac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \mathrm{Cost}(h_\theta(x^{(i)}),y^{(i)}) \newline & \mathrm{Cost}(h_\theta(x),y) = -\log(h_\theta(x)) \; & \text{if y = 1} \newline & \mathrm{Cost}(h_\theta(x),y) = -\log(1-h_\theta(x)) \; & \text{if y = 0}\end{align*}
<p>$$<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/7.png" alt=""><br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& \mathrm{Cost}(h_\theta(x),y) = 0 \text{ if } h_\theta(x) = y \\ & \mathrm{Cost}(h_\theta(x),y) \rightarrow \infty \text{ if } y = 0 \; \mathrm{and} \; h_\theta(x) \rightarrow 1 \\ & \mathrm{Cost}(h_\theta(x),y) \rightarrow \infty \text{ if } y = 1 \; \mathrm{and} \; h_\theta(x) \rightarrow 0 \\ \end{align*}
<p>$$</p>
<ol>
<li>If our correct answer ‘y’ is 0, then the cost function will be 0 if our hypothesis function also outputs 0. If our hypothesis approaches 1, then the cost function will approach infinity. </li>
<li>If our correct answer ‘y’ is 1, then the cost function will be 0 if our hypothesis function outputs 1. If our hypothesis approaches 0, then the cost function will approach infinity. </li>
</ol>
<p>Note that writing the cost function in this way guarantees that $J(θ)$ is convex for logistic regression.</p>
<h2 id="Simplified-Cost-Function-and-Gradient-Descent"><a href="#Simplified-Cost-Function-and-Gradient-Descent" class="headerlink" title="Simplified Cost Function and Gradient Descent"></a>Simplified Cost Function and Gradient Descent</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong>    [6:53 - the gradient descent equation should have a 1/m factor] </p>
<p> We can compress our cost function’s two conditional cases into one case:<br>$$<br>\mathrm{Cost}(h_\theta(x),y) = - y ; \log(h_\theta(x)) - (1 - y) \log(1 - h_\theta(x))<br>$$<br>Notice that when y is equal to 1, then the second term $(1−y)log(1−h_θ(x))$ will be zero and will not affect the result. If y is equal to 0, then the first term $−ylog(h_θ(x))$ will be zero and will not affect the result. </p>
<p>We can fully write out our entire cost function as follows:</p>
<p>$$<br>J(\theta) =  \frac{1}{m} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^m [-y^{(i)}\log (h_\theta (x^{(i)})) - (1 - y^{(i)})\log (1 - h_\theta(x^{(i)}))]<br>$$</p>
<h3 id="A-vectorized-implementation"><a href="#A-vectorized-implementation" class="headerlink" title="A vectorized implementation"></a>A vectorized implementation</h3><p>$$</p>
\begin{align*} & h = g(X\theta)\newline & J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \cdot \left(-y^{T}\log(h)-(1-y)^{T}\log(1-h)\right) \end{align*}
<p>$$</p>

<h2 id="Advanced-Optimization"><a href="#Advanced-Optimization" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Optimization"></a>Advanced Optimization</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong>    [7:35 - ‘100’ should be 100 instead. The value provided should be an integer and not a character string.] </p>
<p><strong>“Conjugate gradient”, “BFGS”, and “L-BFGS”</strong> <em>are more sophisticated, faster ways to optimize $θ$ that can be used instead of gradient descent. We suggest that you should not write these more sophisticated algorithms yourself (unless you are an expert in numerical computing) but use the libraries instead, as they’re already tested and highly optimized. Octave provides them.</em></p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These algorithms actually do more sophisticated things than just pick a good learning rate, and so they often end up converging much faster than gradient descent. These algorithms actually do more sophisticated things than just pick a good learning rate, and so they often end up converging much faster than gradient descent, but detailed discussion of exactly what they do is beyond the scope of this course. <strong>In fact, I actually used to have used these algorithms for a long time, like maybe over a decade, quite frequently, and it was only, you know, a few years ago that I actually figured out for myself the details of what conjugate gradient, BFGS and O-BFGS do. So it is actually entirely possible to use these algorithms successfully and apply to lots of different learning problems without actually understanding the inter-loop of what these algorithms do.</strong> If these algorithms have a disadvantage, I’d say that the main disadvantage is that they’re quite a lot more complex than gradient descent. And in particular, you probably should not implement these algorithms - conjugate gradient, L-BGFS, BFGS - yourself unless you’re an expert in numerical computing. Instead, just as I wouldn’t recommend that you write your own code to compute square roots of numbers or to compute inverses of matrices, for these algorithms also what I would recommend you do is just use a software library. So, you know, to take a square root what all of us do is use some function that someone else has written to compute the square roots of our numbers. And fortunately, Octave and the closely related language MATLAB - we’ll be using that - Octave has a very good. Has a pretty reasonable library implementing some of these advanced optimization algorithms. And so if you just use the built-in library, you know, you get pretty good results. I should say that there is a difference between good and bad implementations of these algorithms. And so, if you’re using a different language for your machine learning application, if you’re using C, C++, Java, and so on, you might want to try out a couple of different libraries to make sure that you find a good library for implementing these algorithms. Because there is a difference in performance between a good implementation of, you know, contour gradient or LPFGS versus less good implementation of contour gradient or LPFGS.</p>
<p>We first need to provide a function that evaluates the following two functions for a given input value $θ$: </p>
<p>We can write a single function that returns both of these: </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function [jVal, gradient] &#x3D; costFunction(theta)</span><br><span class="line">  jVal &#x3D; [...code to compute J(theta)...];</span><br><span class="line">  gradient &#x3D; [...code to compute derivative of J(theta)...];</span><br><span class="line">end</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Then we can use octave’s <strong>“fminunc()”</strong> optimization algorithm along with the <strong>“optimset()”</strong> function that creates an object containing the options we want to send to “fminunc()”. (Note: the value for MaxIter should be an integer, not a character string - errata in the video at 7:30) </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">options &#x3D; optimset(&#39;GradObj&#39;, &#39;on&#39;, &#39;MaxIter&#39;, 100);</span><br><span class="line">initialTheta &#x3D; zeros(2,1);</span><br><span class="line">   [optTheta, functionVal, exitFlag] &#x3D; fminunc(@costFunction, initialTheta, options);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>We give to the function <strong>“fminunc()”</strong> our cost function, our initial vector of theta values, and the “options” object that we created beforehand.</p>
<h2 id="Example"><a href="#Example" class="headerlink" title="Example"></a>Example</h2><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/1st_example_of_costFunction_and_fminunc_in_octave.png" alt="1st_example_of_costFunction_and_fminunc_in_octave"></p>
<p>Having implemented this cost function, you would, you can then call the advanced optimization function called the <strong>‘fminunc’ - it stands for function minimization unconstrained in Octave</strong> -and the way you call this is as follows. </p>
<p>You set a few options. This is a options as a data structure that stores the options you want. <em>So <strong>‘GradObj’ and ‘on’</strong> , these set the gradient objective parameter to on . It just means you are indeed going to provide a gradient to this algorithm ( which tells <code>fminunc</code> that our function returns both the cost and the gradient. This allows <code>fminunc</code> to use the gradient when minimizing the function ). I’m going to <strong>set the maximum number of iterations to</strong>, let’s say, one hundred. We’re going *<em>give it an initial guess for $\theta$ *</em>. There’s a 2 by 1 vector. And then this command calls fminunc. This *<em>‘@’ *</em> symbol presents a pointer to the cost function that we just defined up there. And if you call this, this will compute, you know, will use one of the more advanced optimization  algorithms.  And if you want to think it as just like gradient descent. But automatically choosing the learning rate alpha for so you don’t have to do so yourself. But it will then attempt to use the sort of advanced optimization algorithms. Like gradient descent on steroids. To try to find the optimal value of theta for you.</em>  </p>
<p> Let me actually show you what this looks like in Octave. So I’ve written this cost function of theta function exactly as we had it on the previous line. It computes J-val which is the cost function. And it computes the gradient with the two elements being the partial derivatives of the cost function with respect to, you know, the two parameters, theta one and theta two. </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function [jVal, gradient]&#x3D;costFunction(theta)</span><br><span class="line">　　jVal&#x3D;(theta(1)-5)^2+(theta(2)-5)^2;</span><br><span class="line">　　gradient&#x3D;zeros(2,1);</span><br><span class="line">　　gradient(1)&#x3D;2*(theta(1)-5);</span><br><span class="line">　　gradient(2)&#x3D;2*(theta(2)-5);</span><br><span class="line">end</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Now let’s switch to my Octave window. I’m gonna type in those commands I had just now. So, options equals optimset. </p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">options&#x3D;optimset(&#39;GradObj&#39;,&#39;on&#39;,&#39;MaxIter&#39;,100);</span><br><span class="line">initialTheta&#x3D;zeros(2,1);</span><br><span class="line">[optTheta, functionVal, exitFlag]&#x3D;fminunc(@costFunction, initialTheta, options);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This is the notation for setting my parameters on my options, for my optimization algorithm. And if I hit enter this will run the optimization algorithm. And it returns pretty quickly. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This funny formatting that’s because my line, you know, my code wrapped around. So, this funny thing is just because my command line had wrapped around. But what this says is that numerically renders, you know, think of it as gradient descent on steroids, they found the optimal value of a theta is theta 1 equals 5, theta 2 equals 5, exactly as we’re hoping for. <strong>The <code>functionValue</code> at the optimum is essentially 10-to -the-minus-30-power. So that’s essentially zero, which is also what we’re hoping for</strong> . And the <code>exitFlag</code> is 1, and this shows what the convergence status of this. And if you want you can do help <code>fminunc</code> to read the documentation for how to interpret the exit flag. But <strong>the <code>exitFlag</code> let’s you verify whether or not this algorithm thing has converged</strong>. So that’s how you run these algorithms in Octave. </p>
<p>I should mention, by the way, that for the Octave implementation, this value of theta, your <strong>parameter : vector of theta, its dimension is at least greater than or equal to 2.</strong> So if theta is just a real number. So, if it is not at least a two-dimensional vector or some higher than two-dimensional vector, this <code>fminunc</code> may not work, so and if in case you have a one-dimensional function that you use to optimize, you can look in the octave documentation for <code>fminunc</code> for additional details. </p>
<p>So, that’s how we optimize our trial example of this simple quick driving cost function. However, we apply this to let’s just say progression. In logistic regression we have a parameter vector theta, and I’m going to use a mix of octave notation and sort of math notation. But I hope this explanation will be clear, but our parameter vector theta comprises these parameters theta 0 through theta n because octave indexes, vectors using indexing from 1, you know, theta 0 is actually written theta 1 in octave, theta 1 is gonna be written. So, if theta 2 in octave and that’s gonna be a written theta n+1, right? And that’s because Octave indexes is vectors starting from index of 1 and so the index of 0. <strong>So what we need to do then is write a cost function that captures the cost function for logistic regression. Concretely, the cost function needs to return <code>jVal</code>, which is, you know, <code>jVal</code> as you need some codes to compute J of theta and we also need to give it the gradient.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/06/11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, gradient 1 is going to be some code to compute the partial derivative in respect to theta 0, the next partial derivative respect to theta 1 and so on. Once again, this is gradient 1, gradient 2 and so on, rather than gradient 0, gradient 1 because octave indexes is vectors starting from one rather than from zero. But <strong>the main concept I hope you take away from this slide is, that what you need to do, is write a function that returns the cost function and returns the gradient.</strong> And so in order to apply this to logistic regression or even to linear regression, if you want to use these optimization algorithms for linear regression. What you need to do is plug in the appropriate code to compute these things over here. So, now you know how to use these advanced optimization algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>Because, using, because for these algorithms, you’re using a sophisticated optimization library, it makes the just a little bit more opaque and so just maybe a little bit harder to debug. But because these algorithms often run much faster than gradient descent, often quite typically whenever I have a large machine learning problem, I will use these algorithms instead of using gradient descent. And with these ideas, hopefully, you’ll be able to get logistic progression and also linear regression to work on much larger problems. So, that’s it for advanced optimization concepts.</strong> And in the next and final video on Logistic Regression, I want to tell you how to take the logistic regression algorithm that you already know about and make it work also on multi-class classification problems.</p>
<h2 id="Multiclass-Classification-One-vs-all"><a href="#Multiclass-Classification-One-vs-all" class="headerlink" title="Multiclass Classification: One-vs-all"></a>Multiclass Classification: One-vs-all</h2><p>Now we will approach the classification of data when we have more than two categories. Instead of y = {0,1} we will expand our definition so that y = {0,1…n}.<br>$$</p>
\begin{align*}& y \in \lbrace0, 1 ... n\rbrace \\ & h_\theta^{(0)}(x) = P(y = 0 | x ; \theta) \\ & h_\theta^{(1)}(x) = P(y = 1 | x ; \theta) \\ & \cdots \\ & h_\theta^{(n)}(x) = P(y = n | x ; \theta) \\ & \mathrm{prediction} = \max_i( h_\theta ^{(i)}(x) )\\ \end{align*}
<p>$$<br>Since y = {0,1…n}, we divide our problem into n+1 (+1 because the index starts at 0) binary classification problems; in each one, we predict the probability that ‘y’ is a member of one of our classes.</p>

          <h2 id="Multiple-Features"><a href="#Multiple-Features" class="headerlink" title="Multiple Features"></a>Multiple Features</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong>    [7:25 - $θ^T$ is a 1 by (n+1) matrix and not an (n+1) by 1 matrix] </p>
<p>Linear regression with multiple variables is also known as “multivariate linear regression”. </p>
<p>We now introduce notation for equations where we can have any number of input variables.</p>

$$
\begin{align*}x_j^{(i)} &= \text{value of feature } j \text{ in the }i^{th}\text{ training example} \\ x^{(i)}& = \text{the input (features) of the }i^{th}\text{ training example} \\ m &= \text{the number of training examples} \\ n &= \text{the number of features} \end{align*}
$$

<p>The multivariable form of the hypothesis function accommodating these multiple features is as follows:</p>
<p>$$<br>h_\theta (x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \theta_3 x_3 + \cdots + \theta_n x_n<br>$$</p>
<p>In order to develop intuition about this function, we can think about $θ_0$ as the basic price of a house, $θ_1$ as the price per square meter, $θ_2$ as the price per floor, etc.  $x_1$ will be the number of square meters in the house, $x_2$ the number of floors, etc. </p>
<p>Using the definition of matrix multiplication, our multivariable hypothesis function can be concisely represented as :</p>

$$
\begin{align*}h_\theta(x) =\begin{bmatrix}\theta_0 \hspace{2em} \theta_1 \hspace{2em} ... \hspace{2em} \theta_n\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_n\end{bmatrix}= \theta^T x\end{align*}
$$


<p>This is a vectorization of our hypothesis function for one training example; see the lessons on vectorization to learn more. </p>
<p><strong>Remark : Note that for convenience reasons in this course we assume $x^{(i)}_0=1 \text{ for }(i∈1,…,m)$ . This allows us to do matrix operations with theta and x. Hence making the two vectors ‘ $θ$ ‘ and $x^{(i)}$ match each other element-wise (that is, have the same number of elements: n+1)</strong> .] </p>
<h2 id="Gradient-Descent-For-Multiple-Variables"><a href="#Gradient-Descent-For-Multiple-Variables" class="headerlink" title="Gradient Descent For Multiple Variables"></a>Gradient Descent For Multiple Variables</h2><p>The gradient descent equation itself is generally the same form; we just have to repeat it for our ‘n’ features :</p>

$$
\begin{align*} & \text{repeat until convergence:} \; \lbrace \newline \; & \theta_0 := \theta_0 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \cdot x_0^{(i)}\newline \; & \theta_1 := \theta_1 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \cdot x_1^{(i)} \newline \; & \theta_2 := \theta_2 - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \cdot x_2^{(i)} \newline & \cdots \newline \rbrace \end{align*}
$$


<p>In other words :</p>

$$
\begin{align*}& \text{repeat until convergence:} \; \lbrace \newline \; & \theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) \cdot x_j^{(i)} \; & \text{for j := 0...n}\newline \rbrace\end{align*}
$$


<p>The following image compares gradient descent with one variable to gradient descent with multiple variables:</p>

<h2 id="Gradient-Descent-in-Practice-I-Feature-Scaling"><a href="#Gradient-Descent-in-Practice-I-Feature-Scaling" class="headerlink" title="Gradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling"></a>Gradient Descent in Practice I - Feature Scaling</h2><p> <strong>Note:</strong>    [6:20 - The average size of a house is 1000 but 100 is accidentally written instead] </p>
<p>We can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input values in roughly the same range. This is <strong>because $θ​$ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/04/why_feature_scale.png" alt="why_feature_scale"></p>
<p>The way to prevent this is to modify the ranges of our input variables so that they are all roughly the same. Ideally:<br>$$<br>−1 ≤  x_{(i)} ≤ 1 \text{ or } −0.5 ≤  x_{(i)} ≤ 0.5<br>$$<br>These aren’t exact requirements; we are only trying to speed things up. The goal is to get all input variables into roughly one of these ranges, give or take a few. </p>
<p>Two techniques to help with this are  <strong>feature scaling</strong> and <strong>mean normalization</strong> . </p>
<ol>
<li>Feature scaling involves dividing the input values by the range (i.e. the maximum value minus the minimum value) of the input variable, resulting in a new range of just 1.</li>
<li>Mean normalization involves subtracting the average value for an input variable from the values for that input variable resulting in a new average value for the input variable of just zero. To implement both of these techniques, adjust your input values as shown in this formula:</li>
</ol>
<p>$$<br>x_i := \dfrac{x_i - \mu_i}{s_i}<br>$$</p>
<p>Where $μ_i$ is the average of all the values for feature (i) and $s_i$ is the range of values (max - min), or $s_i$ is the standard deviation.</p>
<p>Note that dividing by the range, or dividing by the standard deviation, give different results. The quizzes in this course use range - the programming exercises use standard deviation. </p>
<p>For example, if $x_i$ represents housing prices with a range of 100 to 2000  and a mean value of 1000, then, $x_i := \dfrac{price-1000}{1900}$</p>

<p><strong>Debugging gradient descent.</strong>  Make a plot with  <strong>number of iterations</strong> on the x-axis. Now plot the cost function, $J(θ)$ over the number of iterations of gradient descent. If $J(θ)$ ever increases, then you probably need to decrease $α$. </p>
<p><strong>Automatic convergence test.</strong> Declare convergence if $J(θ)$ decreases by less than E in one iteration, where E is some small value such as $10^{−3}$. However in practice it’s difficult to choose this threshold value.</p>

<p>It has been proven that if learning rate $α$ is sufficiently small, then $J(θ)$ will decrease on every iteration.</p>

<p>To summarize: </p>
<ol>
<li>If $α$ is too small: slow convergence. </li>
<li>If $α$ is too large: ￼$J(\theta)$ may not decrease on every iteration and thus may not converge.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Features-and-Polynomial-Regression"><a href="#Features-and-Polynomial-Regression" class="headerlink" title="Features and Polynomial Regression"></a>Features and Polynomial Regression</h2><p>We can improve our features and the form of our hypothesis function in a couple different ways. </p>
<p>We can <strong>combine</strong> multiple features into one. For example, we can combine $x_1$ and $x_2$ into a new feature $x_3$ by taking $x_1⋅x_2$ . </p>
<h3 id="Polynomial-Regression"><a href="#Polynomial-Regression" class="headerlink" title="Polynomial Regression"></a><strong>Polynomial Regression</strong></h3><p>Our hypothesis function need not be linear (a straight line) if that does not fit the data well. </p>
<p>We can <strong>change the behavior or curve</strong> of our hypothesis function by making it a quadratic, cubic or square root function (or any other form).</p>
<p>For example, if our hypothesis function is $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1$, then we can create additional features based on $x_1$, to get the quadratic function $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_1^2$, or the cubic function $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_1^2 + \theta_3 x_1^3$ . In the cubic version, we have created new features $x_2$ and $x_3$ where $x_2=x_1^2$ and $x_3=x_1^3$. </p>
<p>To make it a square root function, we could do: $h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 \sqrt{x_1}$</p>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind is, if you choose your features this way then feature scaling becomes very important. </p>
<p>eg. if $x_1$ has range 1 - 1000 then range of $x_1^2$ becomes 1 - 1000000 and that of $x_1^3$ becomes 1 - 1000000000</p>

<h2 id="Normal-Equation"><a href="#Normal-Equation" class="headerlink" title="Normal Equation"></a>Normal Equation</h2><p><strong>Note:</strong>    [8:00 to 8:44 - The design matrix $X$ (in the bottom right side of the slide) given in the example should have elements $x$ with subscript 1 and superscripts varying from 1 to m because for all m training sets there are only 2 features $x_0$ and $x_1$. 12:56 - The $X$ matrix is m by (n+1) and NOT n by n. ] </p>
<p>Gradient descent gives one way of minimizing $J$ . Let’s discuss a second way of doing so, this time performing the minimization explicitly and without resorting to an iterative algorithm. In the “Normal Equation” method, we will minimize $J$ by explicitly taking its derivatives with respect to the θj’s, and setting them to zero. This allows us to find the optimum theta without iteration. The normal equation formula is given below:<br>$$<br>\theta = (X^T X)^{-1}X^T y<br>$$<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/04/construction_of_normal_equation.png" alt="example_of_normal_equation"></p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/ml-andrew-ng/04/construction_of_normal_equation.png" alt="construction_of_normal_equation"></p>
<p>There is  <strong>no need</strong> to do feature scaling with the normal equation. </p>
<p>*<em>The following is a comparison of gradient descent and the normal equation: *</em> </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Gradient Descent</th>
<th>Normal Equation</th>
</tr>

<tbody><tr>
<td>Need to choose alpha</td>
<td>No need to choose alpha</td>

<tr>
<td>Needs many iterations</td>
<td>No need to iterate</td>

</tbody></table>
<p>With the normal equation, computing the inversion has complexity $O(n^3)$ . So if we have a very large number of features, the normal equation will be slow. <strong>In practice, when n exceeds 10,000 it might be a good time to go from a normal solution to an iterative process</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Normal-Equation-Noninvertibility"><a href="#Normal-Equation-Noninvertibility" class="headerlink" title="Normal Equation Noninvertibility"></a>Normal Equation Noninvertibility</h2><p>When implementing the normal equation in octave we want to use the <code>pinv</code> function rather than <code>inv</code> The <code>pinv</code>function will give you a value of $θ$ even if $X^TX$ is not invertible. ( <strong>pinv(A) means calculating the pseudo inverse of matrix A</strong> )</p>
<p>  If $X^TX$ is <strong>noninvertible,</strong> the common causes might be having : </p>
<ul>
<li>Redundant features, where two features are very closely related (i.e. they are linearly dependent)   </li>
<li>Too many features (e.g. m ≤ n). In this case, delete some features or use “regularization” (to be explained in a later lesson).   </li>
</ul>
<p>Solutions to the above problems include deleting a feature that is linearly dependent with another or deleting one or more features when there are too many features.</p>
