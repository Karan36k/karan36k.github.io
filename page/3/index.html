You are in charge of a special task. Leading biology researchers are creating new breeds of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on earth, and your job is to give names to these dinosaurs. If a dinosaur does not like its name, it might go beserk, so choose wisely! </p>

<p>Luckily you have learned some deep learning and you will use it to save the day. Your assistant has collected a list of all the dinosaur names they could find, and compiled them into this <a href="dinos.txt">dataset</a>. (Feel free to take a look by clicking the previous link.) To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character level language model to generate new names. Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names. Hopefully this algorithm will keep you and your team safe from the dinosaurs’ wrath! </p>
<p>By completing this assignment you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to store text data for processing using an RNN </li>
<li>How to synthesize data, by sampling predictions at each time step and passing it to the next RNN-cell unit</li>
<li>How to build a character-level text generation recurrent neural network</li>
<li>Why clipping the gradients is important</li>
</ul>
<p>We will begin by loading in some functions that we have provided for you in <code>rnn_utils</code>. Specifically, you have access to functions such as <code>rnn_forward</code> and <code>rnn_backward</code> which are equivalent to those you’ve implemented in the previous assignment. </p>

<pre><code>There are 19909 total characters and 27 unique characters in your data.</code></pre><p>The characters are a-z (26 characters) plus the “\n” (or newline character), which in this assignment plays a role similar to the <code>&lt;EOS&gt;</code> (or “End of sentence”) token we had discussed in lecture, only here it indicates the end of the dinosaur name rather than the end of a sentence. In the cell below, we create a python dictionary (i.e., a hash table) to map each character to an index from 0-26. We also create a second python dictionary that maps each index back to the corresponding character character. This will help you figure out what index corresponds to what character in the probability distribution output of the softmax layer. Below, <code>char_to_ix</code> and <code>ix_to_char</code> are the python dictionaries. </p>

<caption><center> **Figure 1**: Recurrent Neural Network, similar to what you had built in the previous notebook "Building a RNN - Step by Step".  </center></caption>

<p>At each time-step, the RNN tries to predict what is the next character given the previous characters. The dataset $X = (x^{\langle 1 \rangle}, x^{\langle 2 \rangle}, …, x^{\langle T_x \rangle})$ is a list of characters in the training set, while $Y = (y^{\langle 1 \rangle}, y^{\langle 2 \rangle}, …, y^{\langle T_x \rangle})$ is such that at every time-step $t$, we have $y^{\langle t \rangle} = x^{\langle t+1 \rangle}$. </p>
<h2 id="2-Building-blocks-of-the-model"><a href="#2-Building-blocks-of-the-model" class="headerlink" title="2 - Building blocks of the model"></a>2 - Building blocks of the model</h2><p>In this part, you will build two important blocks of the overall model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gradient clipping: to avoid exploding gradients</li>
<li>Sampling: a technique used to generate characters</li>
</ul>
<p>You will then apply these two functions to build the model.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Clipping-the-gradients-in-the-optimization-loop"><a href="#2-1-Clipping-the-gradients-in-the-optimization-loop" class="headerlink" title="2.1 - Clipping the gradients in the optimization loop"></a>2.1 - Clipping the gradients in the optimization loop</h3><p>In this section you will implement the <code>clip</code> function that you will call inside of your optimization loop. Recall that your overall loop structure usually consists of a forward pass, a cost computation, a backward pass, and a parameter update. Before updating the parameters, you will perform gradient clipping when needed to make sure that your gradients are not “exploding,” meaning taking on overly large values. </p>
<p>In the exercise below, you will implement a function <code>clip</code> that takes in a dictionary of gradients and returns a clipped version of gradients if needed. There are different ways to clip gradients; we will use a simple element-wise clipping procedure, in which every element of the gradient vector is clipped to lie between some range [-N, N]. More generally, you will provide a <code>maxValue</code> (say 10). In this example, if any component of the gradient vector is greater than 10, it would be set to 10; and if any component of the gradient vector is less than -10, it would be set to -10. If it is between -10 and 10, it is left alone. </p>

<caption><center> **Figure 2**: Visualization of gradient descent with and without gradient clipping, in a case where the network is running into slight "exploding gradient" problems. </center></caption>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement the function below to return the clipped gradients of your dictionary <code>gradients</code>. Your function takes in a maximum threshold and returns the clipped versions of your gradients.

<h3 id="2-2-Sampling"><a href="#2-2-Sampling" class="headerlink" title="2.2 - Sampling"></a>2.2 - Sampling</h3><p>Now assume that your model is trained. You would like to generate new text (characters). The process of generation is explained in the picture below:</p>
<img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/jupter/week1/dinosaurus_island/images/dinos3.png" style="width:500;height:300px;">
<caption><center> **Figure 3**: In this picture, we assume the model is already trained. We pass in $x^{\langle 1\rangle} = \vec{0}$ at the first time step, and have the network then sample one character at a time. </center></caption>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement the <code>sample</code> function below to sample characters. You need to carry out 4 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Pass the network the first “dummy” input $x^{\langle 1 \rangle} = \vec{0}$ (the vector of zeros). This is the default input before we’ve generated any characters. We also set $a^{\langle 0 \rangle} = \vec{0}$</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Run one step of forward propagation to get $a^{\langle 1 \rangle}$ and $\hat{y}^{\langle 1 \rangle}$. Here are the equations:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>$$ a^{\langle t+1 \rangle} = \tanh(W_{ax}  x^{\langle t \rangle } + W_{aa} a^{\langle t \rangle } + b)\tag{1}$$</p>
<p>$$ z^{\langle t + 1 \rangle } = W_{ya}  a^{\langle t + 1 \rangle } + b_y \tag{2}$$</p>
<p>$$ \hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle } = softmax(z^{\langle t + 1 \rangle })\tag{3}$$</p>
<p>Note that $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle }$ is a (softmax) probability vector (its entries are between 0 and 1 and sum to 1). $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle}_i$ represents the probability that the character indexed by “i” is the next character.  We have provided a <code>softmax()</code> function that you can use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Carry out sampling: Pick the next character’s index according to the probability distribution specified by $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle }$. This means that if $\hat{y}^{\langle t+1 \rangle }_i = 0.16$, you will pick the index “i” with 16% probability. To implement it, you can use <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>np.random.choice</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of how to use <code>np.random.choice()</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">np.random.seed(<span class="number">0</span>)</span><br><span class="line">p = np.array([<span class="number">0.1</span>, <span class="number">0.0</span>, <span class="number">0.7</span>, <span class="number">0.2</span>])</span><br><span class="line">index = np.random.choice([<span class="number">0</span>, <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">2</span>, <span class="number">3</span>], p = p.ravel())</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This means that you will pick the <code>index</code> according to the distribution:<br>$P(index = 0) = 0.1, P(index = 1) = 0.0, P(index = 2) = 0.7, P(index = 3) = 0.2$.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 4</strong>: The last step to implement in <code>sample()</code> is to overwrite the variable <code>x</code>, which currently stores $x^{\langle t \rangle }$, with the value of $x^{\langle t + 1 \rangle }$. You will represent $x^{\langle t + 1 \rangle }$ by creating a one-hot vector corresponding to the character you’ve chosen as your prediction. You will then forward propagate $x^{\langle t + 1 \rangle }$ in Step 1 and keep repeating the process until you get a “\n” character, indicating you’ve reached the end of the dinosaur name. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-Building-the-language-model"><a href="#3-Building-the-language-model" class="headerlink" title="3 - Building the language model"></a>3 - Building the language model</h2><p>It is time to build the character-level language model for text generation. </p>
<h3 id="3-1-Gradient-descent"><a href="#3-1-Gradient-descent" class="headerlink" title="3.1 - Gradient descent"></a>3.1 - Gradient descent</h3><p>In this section you will implement a function performing one step of stochastic gradient descent (with clipped gradients). You will go through the training examples one at a time, so the optimization algorithm will be stochastic gradient descent. As a reminder, here are the steps of a common optimization loop for an RNN:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward propagate through the RNN to compute the loss</li>
<li>Backward propagate through time to compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters</li>
<li>Clip the gradients if necessary </li>
<li>Update your parameters using gradient descent </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement this optimization process (one step of stochastic gradient descent). </p>
<p>We provide you with the following functions: </p>

<h3 id="3-2-Training-the-model"><a href="#3-2-Training-the-model" class="headerlink" title="3.2 - Training the model"></a>3.2 - Training the model</h3><p>Given the dataset of dinosaur names, we use each line of the dataset (one name) as one training example. Every 100 steps of stochastic gradient descent, you will sample 10 randomly chosen names to see how the algorithm is doing. Remember to shuffle the dataset, so that stochastic gradient descent visits the examples in random order. </p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Follow the instructions and implement <code>model()</code>. When <code>examples[index]</code> contains one dinosaur name (string), to create an example (X, Y), you can use this:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">index = j % len(examples)</span><br><span class="line">X = [<span class="literal">None</span>] + [char_to_ix[ch] <span class="keyword">for</span> ch <span class="keyword">in</span> examples[index]] </span><br><span class="line">Y = X[<span class="number">1</span>:] + [char_to_ix[<span class="string">"\n"</span>]]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Note that we use: <code>index= j % len(examples)</code>, where <code>j = 1....num_iterations</code>, to make sure that <code>examples[index]</code> is always a valid statement (<code>index</code> is smaller than <code>len(examples)</code>).<br>The first entry of <code>X</code> being <code>None</code> will be interpreted by <code>rnn_forward()</code> as setting $x^{\langle 0 \rangle} = \vec{0}$. Further, this ensures that <code>Y</code> is equal to <code>X</code> but shifted one step to the left, and with an additional “\n” appended to signify the end of the dinosaur name. </p>

At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end you could see dinosaur names with cool endings. Feel free to run the algorithm even longer and play with hyperparameters to see if you can get even better results. Our implemetation generated some really cool names like <code>maconucon</code>, <code>marloralus</code> and <code>macingsersaurus</code>. Your model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in <code>saurus</code>, <code>don</code>, <code>aura</code>, <code>tor</code>, etc.</p>
<p>If your model generates some non-cool names, don’t blame the model entirely–not all actual dinosaur names sound cool. (For example, <code>dromaeosauroides</code> is an actual dinosaur name and is in the training set.) But this model should give you a set of candidates from which you can pick the coolest! </p>
<p>This assignment had used a relatively small dataset, so that you could train an RNN quickly on a CPU. Training a model of the english language requires a much bigger dataset, and usually needs much more computation, and could run for many hours on GPUs. We ran our dinosaur name for quite some time, and so far our favoriate name is the great, undefeatable, and fierce: Mangosaurus!</p>

<h2 id="4-Writing-like-Shakespeare"><a href="#4-Writing-like-Shakespeare" class="headerlink" title="4 - Writing like Shakespeare"></a>4 - Writing like Shakespeare</h2><p>The rest of this notebook is optional and is not graded, but we hope you’ll do it anyway since it’s quite fun and informative. </p>
<p>A similar (but more complicated) task is to generate Shakespeare poems. Instead of learning from a dataset of Dinosaur names you can use a collection of Shakespearian poems. Using LSTM cells, you can learn longer term dependencies that span many characters in the text–e.g., where a character appearing somewhere a sequence can influence what should be a different character much much later in ths sequence. These long term dependencies were less important with dinosaur names, since the names were quite short. </p>

<p>Let’s train the model for one more epoch. When it finishes training for an epoch—this will also take a few minutes—you can run <code>generate_output</code>, which will prompt asking you for an input (<code>&lt;</code>40 characters). The poem will start with your sentence, and our RNN-Shakespeare will complete the rest of the poem for you! For example, try “Forsooth this maketh no sense “ (don’t enter the quotation marks). Depending on whether you include the space at the end, your results might also differ–try it both ways, and try other inputs as well. </p>

    Your browser does not support the audio element.
&lt;/audio&gt;</code></pre><p>We have taken care of the preprocessing of the musical data to render it in terms of musical “values.” You can informally think of each “value” as a note, which comprises a pitch and a duration. For example, if you press down a specific piano key for 0.5 seconds, then you have just played a note. In music theory, a “value” is actually more complicated than this–specifically, it also captures the information needed to play multiple notes at the same time. For example, when playing a music piece, you might press down two piano keys at the same time (playng multiple notes at the same time generates what’s called a “chord”). But we don’t need to worry about the details of music theory for this assignment. For the purpose of this assignment, all you need to know is that we will obtain a dataset of values, and will learn an RNN model to generate sequences of values. </p>
<p>Our music generation system will use 78 unique values. Run the following code to load the raw music data and preprocess it into values. This might take a few minutes.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>X</code>: This is an (m, $T_x$, 78) dimensional array. We have m training examples, each of which is a snippet of $T_x =30$ musical values. At each time step, the input is one of 78 different possible values, represented as a one-hot vector. Thus for example, X[i,t,:] is a one-hot vector representating the value of the i-th example at time t. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Y</code>: This is essentially the same as <code>X</code>, but shifted one step to the left (to the past). Similar to the dinosaurus assignment, we’re interested in the network using the previous values to predict the next value, so our sequence model will try to predict $y^{\langle t \rangle}$ given $x^{\langle 1\rangle}, \ldots, x^{\langle t \rangle}$. However, the data in <code>Y</code> is reordered to be dimension $(T_y, m, 78)$, where $T_y = T_x$. This format makes it more convenient to feed to the LSTM later. </p>
</li>
<li><p><code>n_values</code>: The number of unique values in this dataset. This should be 78. </p>

This is similar to the Dinosaurus model you had used in the previous notebook, except that in you will be implementing it in Keras. The architecture is as follows: </p>

<caption><center> **Figure 1**: LSTM model. $X = (x^{\langle 1 \rangle}, x^{\langle 2 \rangle}, ..., x^{\langle T_x \rangle})$ is a window of size $T_x$ scanned over the musical corpus. Each $x^{\langle t \rangle}$ is an index corresponding to a value (ex: "A,0.250,< m2,P-4 >") while $\hat{y}$ is the prediction for the next value  </center></caption>
!--> 

<p>We will be training the model on random snippets of 30 values taken from a much longer piece of music. Thus, we won’t bother to set the first input $x^{\langle 1 \rangle} = \vec{0}$, which we had done previously to denote the start of a dinosaur name, since now most of these snippets of audio start somewhere in the middle of a piece of music. We are setting each of the snippts to have the same length $T_x = 30$ to make vectorization easier. </p>
<h2 id="2-Building-the-model"><a href="#2-Building-the-model" class="headerlink" title="2 - Building the model"></a>2 - Building the model</h2><p>In this part you will build and train a model that will learn musical patterns. To do so, you will need to build a model that takes in X of shape $(m, T_x, 78)$ and Y of shape $(T_y, m, 78)$. We will use an LSTM with 64 dimensional hidden states. Lets set <code>n_a = 64</code>. </p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">n_a = <span class="number">64</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>


<p>Here’s how you can create a Keras model with multiple inputs and outputs. If you’re building an RNN where even at test time entire input sequence $x^{\langle 1 \rangle}, x^{\langle 2 \rangle}, \ldots, x^{\langle T_x \rangle}$ were <em>given in advance</em>, for example if the inputs were words and the output was a label, then Keras has simple built-in functions to build the model. However, for sequence generation, at test time we don’t know all the values of $x^{\langle t\rangle}$ in advance; instead we generate them one at a time using $x^{\langle t\rangle} = y^{\langle t-1 \rangle}$. So the code will be a bit more complicated, and you’ll need to implement your own for-loop to iterate over the different time steps. </p>
<p>The function <code>djmodel()</code> will call the LSTM layer $T_x$ times using a for-loop, and it is important that all $T_x$ copies have the same weights. I.e., it should not re-initiaiize the weights every time—the $T_x$ steps should have shared weights. The key steps for implementing layers with shareable weights in Keras are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Define the layer objects (we will use global variables for this).</li>
<li>Call these objects when propagating the input.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have defined the layers objects you need as global variables. Please run the next cell to create them. Please check the Keras documentation to make sure you understand what these layers are: <a href="https://keras.io/layers/core/#reshape" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reshape()</a>, <a href="https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#lstm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LSTM()</a>, <a href="https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dense()</a>.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">reshapor = Reshape((<span class="number">1</span>, <span class="number">78</span>))                        <span class="comment"># Used in Step 2.B of djmodel(), below</span></span><br><span class="line">LSTM_cell = LSTM(n_a, return_state = <span class="literal">True</span>)         <span class="comment"># Used in Step 2.C</span></span><br><span class="line">densor = Dense(n_values, activation=<span class="string">'softmax'</span>)     <span class="comment"># Used in Step 2.D</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Each of <code>reshapor</code>, <code>LSTM_cell</code> and <code>densor</code> are now layer objects, and you can use them to implement <code>djmodel()</code>. In order to propagate a Keras tensor object X through one of these layers, use <code>layer_object(X)</code> (or <code>layer_object([X,Y])</code> if it requires multiple inputs.). For example, <code>reshapor(X)</code> will propagate X through the <code>Reshape((1,78))</code> layer defined above.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement <code>djmodel()</code>. You will need to carry out 2 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create an empty list “outputs” to save the outputs of the LSTM Cell at every time step.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Loop for $t \in 1, \ldots, T_x$:</p>
<p> A. Select the “t”th time-step vector from X. The shape of this selection should be (78,). To do so, create a custom <a href="https://keras.io/layers/core/#lambda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lambda</a> layer in Keras by using this line of code:</p>

<h2 id="3-Generating-music"><a href="#3-Generating-music" class="headerlink" title="3 - Generating music"></a>3 - Generating music</h2><p>You now have a trained model which has learned the patterns of the jazz soloist. Lets now use this model to synthesize new music. </p>

<p>At each step of sampling, you will take as input the activation <code>a</code> and cell state <code>c</code> from the previous state of the LSTM, forward propagate by one step, and get a new output activation as well as cell state. The new activation <code>a</code> can then be used to generate the output, using <code>densor</code> as before. </p>
<p>To start off the model, we will initialize <code>x0</code> as well as the LSTM activation and and cell value <code>a0</code> and <code>c0</code> to be zeros. </p>
<!-- 
You are about to build a function that will do this inference for you. Your function takes in your previous model and the number of time steps `Ty` that you want to sample. It will return a keras model that would be able to generate sequences for you. Furthermore, the function takes in a dense layer of `78` units and the number of activations.

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> Implement the function below to sample a sequence of musical values. Here are some of the key steps you’ll need to implement inside the for-loop that generates the $T_y$ output characters: </p>
<p>Step 2.A: Use <code>LSTM_Cell</code>, which inputs the previous step’s <code>c</code> and <code>a</code> to generate the current step’s <code>c</code> and <code>a</code>. </p>
<p>Step 2.B: Use <code>densor</code> (defined previously) to compute a softmax on <code>a</code> to get the output for the current step. </p>
<p>Step 2.C: Save the output you have just generated by appending it to <code>outputs</code>.</p>
<p>Step 2.D: Sample x to the be “out”‘s one-hot version (the prediction) so that you can pass it to the next LSTM’s step.  We have already provided this line of code, which uses a <a href="https://keras.io/layers/core/#lambda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lambda</a> function. </p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement <code>predict_and_sample()</code>. This function takes many arguments including the inputs [x_initializer, a_initializer, c_initializer]. In order to predict the output corresponding to this input, you will need to carry-out 3 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use your inference model to predict an output given your set of inputs. The output <code>pred</code> should be a list of length $T_y$ where each element is a numpy-array of shape (1, n_values).</li>
<li>Convert <code>pred</code> into a numpy array of $T_y$ indices. Each index corresponds is computed by taking the <code>argmax</code> of an element of the <code>pred</code> list. <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hint</a>.</li>

<h4 id="3-3-Generate-music"><a href="#3-3-Generate-music" class="headerlink" title="3.3 - Generate music"></a>3.3 - Generate music</h4><p>Finally, you are ready to generate music. Your RNN generates a sequence of values. The following code generates music by first calling your <code>predict_and_sample()</code> function. These values are then post-processed into musical chords (meaning that multiple values or notes can be played at the same time). </p>
<p>Most computational music algorithms use some post-processing because it is difficult to generate music that sounds good without such post-processing. The post-processing does things such as clean up the generated audio by making sure the same sound is not repeated too many times, that two successive notes are not too far from each other in pitch, and so on. One could argue that a lot of these post-processing steps are hacks; also, a lot the music generation literature has also focused on hand-crafting post-processors, and a lot of the output quality depends on the quality of the post-processing and not just the quality of the RNN. But this post-processing does make a huge difference, so lets use it in our implementation as well. </p>

Here's what you should remember:
- A sequence model can be used to generate musical values, which are then post-processed into midi music. 
- Fairly similar models can be used to generate dinosaur names or to generate music, with the major difference being the input fed to the model.  
- In Keras, sequence generation involves defining layers with shared weights, which are then repeated for the different time steps $1, \ldots, T_x$.

          <h2 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h2><p>This is my personal lecture note after studying the course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nlp sequence models</a> at the 1st week and the copyright belongs to <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeplearning.ai</a>.</p>
<h3 id="01-why-sequence-models"><a href="#01-why-sequence-models" class="headerlink" title="01_why-sequence-models"></a>01_why-sequence-models</h3><p>Welcome to this fifth course on deep learning. In this course, you learn about sequence models, one of the most exciting areas in deep learning. Models like recurrent neural networks or RNNs have transformed speech recognition, natural language processing and other areas. And in this course, you learn how to build these models for yourself. Let’s start by looking at a few examples of where sequence models can be useful. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/1.png" alt=""><br>In speech recognition you are given an input audio clip X and asked to map it to a text transcript Y. Both the input and the output here are sequence data, because X is an audio clip and so that plays out over time and Y, the output, is a sequence of words. So sequence models such as a recurrent neural networks and other variations, you’ll learn about in a little bit have been very useful for speech recognition. Music generation is another example of a problem with sequence data. In this case, only the output Y is a sequence, the input can be the empty set, or it can be a single integer, maybe referring to the genre of music you want to generate or maybe the first few notes of the piece of music you want. But here X can be nothing or maybe just an integer and output Y is a sequence. In sentiment classification the input X is a sequence, so given the input phrase like, “There is nothing to like in this movie” how many stars do you think this review will be? Sequence models are also very useful for DNA sequence analysis. So your DNA is represented via the four alphabets A, C, G, and T. And so given a DNA sequence can you label which part of this DNA sequence say corresponds to a protein. In machine translation you are given an input sentence, voulez-vou chante avec moi? And you’re asked to output the translation in a different language. In video activity recognition you might be given a sequence of video frames and asked to recognize the activity. And in name entity recognition you might be given a sentence and asked to identify the people in that sentence. <strong>So all of these problems can be addressed as supervised learning with label data X, Y as the training set. But, as you can tell from this list of examples, there are a lot of different types of sequence problems. In some, both the input X and the output Y are sequences, and in that case (speech recognition), sometimes X and Y can have different lengths, or in this example (at DNA case) and this example(at Name entity recognition), X and Y have the same length. And in some of these examples only either X or only the opposite Y is a sequence. So in this course you learn about sequence models are applicable, so all of these different settings</strong>. </p>
<p>So I hope this gives you a sense of the exciting set of problems that sequence models might be able to help you to address. With that let us go on to the next video where we start to define the notation we use to define these sequence-models.</p>
<h3 id="02-notation"><a href="#02-notation" class="headerlink" title="02_notation"></a>02_notation</h3><p>In the last video, you saw some of the wide range of applications through which you can apply sequence models. Let’s start by defining a notation that we’ll use to build up these sequence models. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/2.png" alt=""><br>As a motivating example, let’s say you want to build a sequence model to input a sentence like this, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger invented a new spell. And these are characters by the way, from the Harry Potter sequence of novels by J. K. Rowling. And let say you want a sequence model to automatically tell you where are the peoples names in this sentence. So, this is a problem called Named-entity recognition and this is used by search engines for example, to index all of say the last 24 hours news of all the people mentioned in the news articles so that they can index them appropriately. And name into the recognition systems can be used to find people’s names, companies names, times, locations, countries names, currency names, and so on in different types of text. Now, given this input x let’s say that you want a model to operate y that has one outputs per input word and the target output the design y tells you for each of the input words is that part of a person’s name. And technically this maybe isn’t the best output representation, there are some more sophisticated output representations that tells you not just is a word part of a person’s name, but tells you where are the start and ends of people’s names their sentence, you want to know Harry Potter starts here, and ends here, starts here, and ends here. But for this motivating example, I’m just going to stick with this simpler output representation. Now, the input is the sequence of nine words. So, eventually we’re going to have nine sets of features to represent these nine words, and index into the positions and sequence, I’m going to use X and then superscript angle brackets 1, 2, 3 and so on up to X angle brackets nine to index into the different positions. <strong>I’m going to use $X^{<t>}$ with the index t to index into positions, in the middle of the sequence</strong>. And t implies that these are temporal sequences although whether the sequences are temporal one or not, I’m going to use the index t to index into the positions in the sequence. And similarly for the outputs, we’re going to refer to these outputs as y and go back at 1, 2, 3 and so on up to y nine. Let’s also used T sub of x to denote the length of the input sequence, so in this case there are nine words. So $T_x$ is equal to 9 and we used $T_y$ to denote the length of the output sequence. In this example $T_x$ is equal to $T_y$ but you saw on the last video $T_x$ and $T_y$ can be different. So, you will remember that in the notation we’ve been using, we’ve been writing X round brackets i to denote the i training example. So, to refer to the TIF element or the TIF element in the sequence of training example i will use this notation and if $T_x$ is the length of a sequence then different examples in your training set can have different lengths. And so $T_x^i$ would be the input sequence length for training example i, and similarly $y^{(i)<t>}$ means the TIF element in the output sequence of the i for an example and $T_y^i$ will be the length of the output sequence in the i training example. So into this example, $T_x^i$ is equal to 9 would be the highly different training example with a sentence of 15 words and $T_x^i$ will be close to 15 for that different training example. Now, that we’re starting to work in NLP or Natural Language Processing. Now, this is our first serious foray into NLP or Natural Language Processing. And one of the things we need to decide is, how to represent individual words in the sequence. So, how do you represent a word like Harry, and why should $x^{&lt;1&gt;}$ really be? Let’s next talk about how we would represent individual words in a sentence. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/3.png" alt=""><br>So, to represent a word in the sentence the first thing you do is come up with a Vocabulary. Sometimes also called a <strong>Dictionary</strong> and that means making a list of the words that you will use in your representations. So the first word in the vocabulary is a, that will be the first word in the dictionary. The second word is Aaron and then a little bit further down is the word and, and then eventually you get to the words Harry then eventually the word Potter, and then all the way down to maybe the last word in dictionary is Zulu. And so, a will be word one, Aaron is word two, and in my dictionary the word and appears in positional index 367. Harry appears in position 4075, Potter in position 6830, and Zulu is the last word to the dictionary is maybe word 10,000. So in this example, I’m going to use a dictionary with size 10,000 words. This is quite small by modern NLP applications. For commercial applications, for visual size commercial applications, dictionary sizes of 30 to 50,000 are more common and 100,000 is not uncommon. And then some of the large Internet companies will use dictionary sizes that are maybe a million words or even bigger than that. But you see a lot of commercial applications used dictionary sizes of maybe 30,000 or maybe 50,000 words. But I’m going to use 10,000 for illustration since it’s a nice round number. So, if you have chosen a dictionary of 10,000 words and one way to build this dictionary will be be to look through your training sets and find the top 10,000 occurring words, also look through some of the online dictionaries that tells you what are the most common 10,000 words in the English Language saved. What you can do is then <strong>use one hot representations to represent each of these words. For example, $x^{&lt;1&gt;}$ which represents the word Harry would be a vector with all zeros except for a 1 in position 4075 because that was the position of Harry in the dictionary</strong>. And then $x^{&lt;2&gt;}$ will be again similarly a vector of all zeros except for a 1 in position 6830 and then zeros everywhere else. The word and was represented as position 367 so $x^{&lt;3&gt;}$ would be a vector with zeros of 1 in position 367 and then zeros everywhere else. And each of these would be a 10,000 dimensional vector if your vocabulary has 10,000 words. And this one A, I guess because A is the first whether the dictionary, then $x^{&lt;7&gt;}$ which corresponds to word a, that would be the vector 1. This is the first element of the dictionary and then zero everywhere else. So in this representation, $x^{<t>}$ for each of the values of t in a sentence will be a one-hot vector, one-hot because there’s exactly one one is on and zero everywhere else and you will have nine of them to represent the nine words in this sentence. And the goal is given this representation for X to learn a mapping using a sequence model to then target output y, I will do this as a supervised learning problem, I’m sure given the table data with both x and y. Then just one last detail, which we’ll talk more about in a later video is, what if you encounter a word that is not in your vocabulary? Well the answer is, <strong>you create a new token or a new fake word called Unknown Word which under note as follows and go back as UNK to represent words not in your vocabulary, we’ll come more to talk more about this later</strong>. </p>
<p>So, to summarize in this video, we described a notation for describing your training set for both x and y for sequence data. In the next video let’s start to describe a Recurrent Neural Networks for learning the mapping from X to Y.</p>
<h3 id="03-recurrent-neural-network-model"><a href="#03-recurrent-neural-network-model" class="headerlink" title="03_recurrent-neural-network-model"></a>03_recurrent-neural-network-model</h3><p>In the last video, you saw the notation we used to define sequence learning problems. Now, let’s talk about how you can build a model, build a neural network to drawing the mapping from X to Y. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/4.png" alt=""><br>Now, one thing you could do is try to use a standard neural network for this task. So in our previous example, we had nine input words. So you could imagine trying to take these nine input words, maybe the nine one hot vectors and feeding them into a standard neural network, maybe a few hidden layers and then eventually, have this output the nine values zero or one that tell you whether each word is part of a person’s name. But this turns out not to work well, and there are really two main problems with this. The first is that the inputs and outputs can be different lengths in different examples. So it’s not as if every single example has the same input length $T^{<X>}$ or the same output length $T^{<Y>}$. And maybe if every sentence had a maximum length, maybe you could pad, or zero pad every input up to that maximum length, but this still doesn’t seem like a good representation. And in a second, it might be more serious problem is that a naive neural network architecture like this, it doesn’t share features learned across different positions of techs. In particular, if the neural network has learned that maybe the word heavy appearing in position one gives a sign that that is part of a person’s name, then one would be nice if it automatically figures out that heavy appearing in some other position, $X^{<T>}$ also means that that might be a person’s name. <strong>And this is maybe similar to what you saw in convolutional neural networks where you want things learned for one part of the image to generalize quickly to other parts of the image, and we’d like similar effect for sequence data as well</strong>. And similar to what you saw with ConvNets using a better representation will also let you reduce the number of parameters in your model. So previously, we said that each of these is a 10,000 dimensional one vector. And so, this is just a very large input layer. If the total input size was maximum number of words times 10,000, and the weight matrix of this first layer would end up having an enormous number of parameters. So a recurrent neural network which will start to describe in the next slide, does not have either of these disadvantages. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/5.png" alt=""><br>So what is a recurrent neural network? Let’s build one out. So if you are reading the sentence from left to right, the first word you read is the some first where say X1. What we’re going to do is take the first word and feed it into a neural network layer. I’m going to draw it like this. So that’s a hidden layer of the first neural network. And look at how the neural network maybe try to predict the output. So is this part of a person’s name or not? And what a recurrent neural network does is when it then goes on to read the second word in a sentence, say X2, instead of just predicting Y2 using only X2, it also gets to input some information from whether a computer that time-step ones. So in particular, the activation value from time-step one is passed on to time-step 2. And then, at the next time-step, a recurrent neural network inputs the third word X3, and it tries to predict, output some prediction y-hat 3, and so on, up until the last time-step where inputs $X^{<T_x>}$, and then it outputs Y hat TY. In this example, Tx=Ty, and the architecture will change a bit if Tx and Ty are not identical. And so, at each time-step, the recurrent neural network passes on this activation to the next time-step for it to use. <strong>And to kick off the whole thing, we’ll also have some made up activation at time zero. This is usually the vector of zeroes. Some researchers will initialize a zero randomly have other ways to initialize a zero but really having a vector zero is just a fake. Time Zero activation is the most common choice</strong>. And so that does input into the neural network. <strong>In some research papers or in some books, you see this type of neural network drawn with the following diagram in which every time-step, you input X and output Y hat, maybe sometimes there will be a T index there, and then to denote the recurrent connection, sometimes people will draw a loop like that, that the layer feeds back to itself. Sometimes they’ll draw a shaded box to denote that this is the shaded box here, denotes a time delay of one step. I personally find these recurrent diagrams much harder to interpret. And so throughout this course, I will tend to draw the on the road diagram like the one you have on the left. But if you see something like the diagram on the right in a textbook or in a research paper, what it really means, or the way I tend to think about it is the mentally unrolled into the diagram you have on the left hand side</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>The recurrent neural network scans through the data from left to right. And the parameters it uses for each time step are shared</strong>. So there will be a set of parameters which we’ll describe in greater detail on the next slide, but the parameters governing the connection from X1 to the hidden layer will be some set of the parameters we’re going to write as WAX, and it’s the same parameters $W_{ax}$ that it uses for every time-step I guess you could write $W_{ax}$ there as well. And the activations, the horizontal connections, will be governed by some set of parameters $W_{aa}$, and is the same parameters $W_{aa}$ use on every time-step, and similarly, the sum $W_{ya}$ that governs the output predictions. And I’ll describe in the next slide exactly how these parameters work. So in this recurrent neural network, what this means is that we’re making the prediction for Y3 against the information not only from X3, but also the information from X1 and X2, because the information of X1 can pass through this way to help the prediction with Y3. <strong>Now one weakness of this RNN is that it only uses the information that is earlier in the sequence to make a prediction, in particular, when predicting Y3, it doesn’t use information about the words X4, X5, X6 and so on</strong>. And so this is a problem because if you’re given a sentence, he said, “Teddy Roosevelt was a great president.” In order to decide whether or not the word Teddy is part of a person’s name, it be really useful to know not just information from the first two words but to know information from the later words in the sentence as well, because the sentence could also happen, he said, “Teddy bears are on sale!” <strong>And so, given just the first three words, it’s not possible to know for sure whether the word Teddy is part of a person’s name. In the first example, it is, in the second example, is not, but you can’t tell the difference if you look only at the first three words. So one limitation of this particular neural network structure is that the prediction at a certain time uses inputs or uses information from the inputs earlier in the sequence but not information later in the sequence</strong>. We will address this in a later video where we talk about a <strong>bidirectional recurrent neural networks or BRNNs</strong>. But for now, this simpler uni-directional neural network architecture will suffice for us to explain the key concepts. And we just have to make a quick modifications in these ideas later to enable say the prediction of Y-hat 3 to use both information earlier in the sequence as well as information later in the sequence, but we’ll get to that in a later video. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/6.png" alt=""><br>So let’s not write to explicitly what are the calculations that this neural network does. Here’s a cleaned out version of the picture of the neural network. As I mentioned previously, typically, you started off with the input a0 equals the vector of all zeroes. Next. This is what a forward propagation looks like. To compute a1, you would compute that as an activation function g, applied to Waa times a0 plus W a x times x1 plus a bias was going to write it as ba, and then to compute y hat 1 the prediction of times that one, that will be some activation function, maybe a different activation function, than the one above. But apply to WYA times a1 plus b y. And the notation convention I’m going to use for the sub zero of these matrices like that example, W a x. The second index means that this W a x is going to be multiplied by some x like quantity, and this means that this is used to compute some a like quantity. Like like so. And similarly, you notice that here WYA is multiplied by a sum a like quantity to compute a y type quantity. The activation function used in-to compute the activations will often be a tonnage and the choice of an RNN and sometimes, values are also used although the tonnage is actually a pretty common choice. And we have other ways of preventing the vanishing gradient problem which we’ll talk about later this week. And depending on what your output y is, if it is a binary classification problem, then I guess you would use a sigmoid activation function or it could be a soft Max if you have a ky classification problem. But the choice of activation function here would depend on what type of output y you have. So, for the name entity recognition task, where Y was either zero or one. I guess the second g could be a signal and activation function. And I guess you could write g2 if you want to distinguish that this is these could be different activation functions but I usually won’t do that. And then, more generally at time t, a t will be g of W a a times a, from the previous time-step, plus W a x of x from the current time-step plus B a, and y hat t is equal to g, again, it could be different activation functions but g of WYA times a t plus B y. So, these equations define for propagation in the neural network. Where you would start off with a zeroes [inaudible] and then using a zero and X1, you will compute a1 and y hat one, and then you, take X2 and use X2 and A1 to compute A2 and Y hat two and so on, and you carry out for propagation going from the left to the right of this picture. Now, in order to help us develop the more complex neural networks, I’m actually going to take this notation and simplify it a little bit. So, let me copy these two equations in the next slide. Right. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/7.png" alt=""><br>Here they are, and what I’m going to do is actually take- so to simplify the notation a bit, I’m actually going to take that and write in a slightly simpler way. And someone very does this a<t> = g times just a matrix $W_a$ times a new quantity is going to be $a^{<t-1>}$ comma $x^{<t>}$ and then, plus B a. And so, that underlining quantity on the left and right are supposed to be equivalent. So, the way we define $W_{a}$ is we’ll take this matrix $W_{aa}$ and this matrix $W_{ax}$. And put them side by side and stack them horizontally as follows. And this will be the matrix $W_{a}$. So for example, if a was a hundred dimensional, and then another example, X was 10,000 dimensional, then $W_{aa}$ would have been a 100 by 100 dimensional matrix and $W_{ax}$ would have been a 100 by 10,000 dimensional matrix. And so stacking these two matrices together this would be 100 dimensional. This would be 100, and this would be I guess 10,000 elements. So $W_{a}$ will be a 100 by one zero one zero zero zero dimensional matrix. I guess this diagram on the left is not drawn to scale. Since $W_{ax}$ would be a very wide matrix. And what this notation means, is to just take the two vectors, and stack them together. So, let me use that notation to denote that we’re going to take the vector $a^{<t-1>}$. So there’s a 100 dimensional and stack it on top of $a^{<t>}$. So this ends up being a one zero one zero zero dimensional vector. And so hopefully, you check for yourself that this matrix times this vector, just gives you back to the original quantity. Right. Because now, this matrix $W_{aa}$ times $W_{ax}$ multiplied by this $a^{<t-1>}$ $x^{<t>}$ vector, this is just equal to $W_{aa}$ times $a^{<t-1>}$ plus $W_{ax}$ times x t which is exactly what we had back over here. So, the advantages of this notation is that rather than carrying around two parameter matrices $W_{aa}$ and $W_{ax}$, we can compress them into just one parameter matrix $W_{a}$. And this will simplify a notation for when we develop more complex models. And then, for this, in a similar way I’m just going to rewrite this slightly with the ranges as $W_y$ $a^{<t>}$ plus $b_y$. And now, we just have the substrates in the notation $W_y$ and $b_y$, it denotes what type of output quantity over computing. So $W_y$ indicates that there’s a weight matrix of computing a y like quantity and here a Wa and ba on top. In the case of those the parameters of computing that an a and activation output quantity. </p>
<p>So, that’s it. You now know, what is a basic recurrent network. Next, let’s talk about back propagation and how you learn with these RNNs.</p>
<h3 id="04-backpropagation-through-time"><a href="#04-backpropagation-through-time" class="headerlink" title="04_backpropagation-through-time"></a>04_backpropagation-through-time</h3><p>You’ve already learned about the basic structure of an RNN. In this video, you’ll see how backpropagation in a recurrent neural network works. As usual, when you implement this in one of the programming frameworks, often, the programming framework will automatically take care of backpropagation. But I think it’s still useful to have a rough sense of how backprop works in RNNs. Let’s take a look. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/8.png" alt=""><br>You’ve seen how, for forward prop, you would computes these activations from left to right as follows in the neural network, and so you’ve outputs all of the predictions. In backprop, as you might already have guessed, you end up carrying backpropagation calculations in basically the opposite direction of the forward prop arrows. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/9.png" alt=""><br>So, let’s go through the forward propagation calculation. You’re given this input sequence $x^{&lt;1&gt;}, x^{&lt;2&gt;}, x^{&lt;3&gt;}$, up to $x^{<T_x>}$. And then using $x^{&lt;1&gt;}$ and say, $a^{&lt;0&gt;}$, you’re going to compute the activation, times that one, and then together, $x^{&lt;2&gt;}$ together with $a^{&lt;1&gt;}$ are used to compute $a^{&lt;2&gt;}$, and then $a^{&lt;3&gt;}$, and so on, up to $a^{<T_x>}$. All right. And then to actually compute $a^{&lt;1&gt;}$, you also need the parameters. We’ll just draw this in green, $W_a$ and $b_a$, those are the parameters that are used to compute $a^{&lt;1&gt;}$. And then, these parameters are actually used for every single timestep so, these parameters are actually used to compute $a^{&lt;1&gt;}$, $a^{&lt;3&gt;}$, and so on, all the activations up to last timestep depend on the parameters $W_a$ and $b_a$. Let’s keep fleshing out this graph. Now, given $a^{&lt;1&gt;}$, your neural network can then compute the first prediction, $\hat{y}^{&lt;1&gt;}$, and then the second timestep, $\hat{y}^{&lt;2&gt;}$, $\hat{y}^{&lt;3&gt;}$, and so on, with $\hat{y}^{<T_y>}$. And let me again draw the parameters of a different color. So, to compute $\hat{y}$, you need the parameters, $W_y$ as well as $b_y$, and this goes into this node as well as all the others. So, I’ll draw this in green as well. Next, in order to compute backpropagation, you need a loss function. So let’s define an element-wise loss force, which is supposed for a certain word in the sequence. It is a person’s name, so $y^{<t>}$ is one. And your neural network outputs some probability of maybe 0.1 of the particular word being a person’s name. So I’m going to define this as the standard logistic regression loss, also called the cross entropy loss. This may look familiar to you from where we were previously looking at binary classification problems. So this is the loss associated with a single prediction at a single position or at a single time set, t, for a single word. Let’s now define the overall loss of the entire sequence, so L will be defined as the sum overall t equals one to, i guess, $T_x$ or $T_y$. $T_x$ is equals to $T_y$ in this example of the losses for the individual timesteps, comma $y^{<t>}$. And then, so, just have to L without this superscript T. This is the loss for the entire sequence. So, in a computation graph, to compute the loss given $\hat{y}^{&lt;1&gt;}$, you can then compute the loss for the first timestep given that you compute the loss for the second timestep, the loss for the third timestep, and so on, the loss for the final timestep. And then lastly, to compute the overall loss, we will take these and sum them all up to compute the final L using that equation, which is the sum of the individual per timestep losses. So, this is the computation problem and from the earlier examples you’ve seen of backpropagation, it shouldn’t surprise you that backprop then just requires doing computations or parsing messages in the opposite directions. So, all of the four propagation steps arrows, so you end up doing that. And that then, allows you to compute all the appropriate quantities that lets you then, take the riveters, respected parameters, and update the parameters using gradient descent. Now, in this back propagation procedure, the most significant message or the most significant recursive calculation is this one, which goes from right to left, and that’s why it gives this algorithm as well, a pretty fast full name called <strong>backpropagation through time</strong>. And the motivation for this name is that for forward prop, you are scanning from left to right, increasing indices of the time, t, whereas, the backpropagation, you’re going from right to left, you’re kind of going backwards in time. So this gives this, I think a really cool name, backpropagation through time, where you’re going backwards in time, right? That phrase really makes it sound like you need a time machine to implement this output, but I just thought that backprop through time is just one of the coolest names for an algorithm. </p>
<p>So, I hope that gives you a sense of how forward prop and backprop in RNN works. <strong>Now, so far, you’ve only seen this main motivating example in RNN, in which the length of the input sequence was equal to the length of the output sequence. In the next video, I want to show you a much wider range of RNN architecture, so I’ll let you tackle a much wider set of applications</strong>. Let’s go on to the next video.</p>
<h3 id="05-different-types-of-rnns"><a href="#05-different-types-of-rnns" class="headerlink" title="05_different-types-of-rnns"></a>05_different-types-of-rnns</h3><p>So far, you’ve seen an RNN architecture where the number of inputs, Tx, is equal to the number of outputs, Ty. It turns out that for other applications, Tx and Ty may not always be the same, and in this video, you’ll see a much richer family of RNN architectures. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/10.png" alt=""><br>You might remember this slide from the first video of this week, where the input x and the output y can be many different types. And it’s not always the case that $T_x$ has to be equal to $T_y$. In particular, in this example, $T_x$ can be length one or even an empty set. And then, an example like movie sentiment classification, the output y could be just an integer from 1 to 5, whereas the input is a sequence. And in name entity recognition, in the example we’re using, the input length and the output length are identical, but there are also some problems were the input length and the output length can be different.They’re both our sequences but have different lengths, such as machine translation where a French sentence and English sentence can mean two different numbers of words to say the same thing. So it turns out that we could modify the basic RNN architecture to address all of these problems. And the presentation in this video was inspired by a blog post by Andrej Karpathy, titled, The <strong>Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/11.png" alt=""><br>Let’s go through some examples. The example you’ve seen so far use $T_x$ equals $T_y$, where we had an input sequence x(1), x(2) up to x(Tx), and we had a recurrent neural network that works as follows when we would input x(1) to compute y hat (1), y hat (2), and so on up to y hat (Ty), as follows. And in early diagrams, I was drawing a bunch of circles here to denote neurons but I’m just going to make those little circles for most of this video, just to make the notation simpler. So, this is what you might call a many-to-many architecture because the input sequence has many inputs as a sequence and the outputs sequence is also has many outputs. Now, let’s look at a different example. Let’s say, you want to address sentiments classification. Here, x might be a piece of text, such as it might be a movie review that says, “There is nothing to like in this movie.” So x is going to be sequenced, and y might be a number from 1 to 5, or maybe 0 or 1. This is a positive review or a negative review, or it could be a number from 1 to 5. Do you think this is a one-star, two-star, three, four, or five-star review? So in this case, we can simplify the neural network architecture as follows. I will input x(1), x(2). So, input the words one at a time. So if the input text was, “There is nothing to like in this movie.” So “There is nothing to like in this movie,” would be the input. And then rather than having to use an output at every single time-step, we can then just have the RNN read into entire sentence and have it output y at the last time-step when it has already input the entire sentence. So, this neural network would be a many-to-one architecture. Because as many inputs, it inputs many words and then it just outputs one number. For the sake of completeness, there is also a one-to-one architecture. So this one is maybe less interesting. The smaller the standard neural network, we have some input x and we just had some output y. And so, this would be the type of neural network that we covered in the first two courses in this sequence. Now, in addition to many-to-one, you can also have a one-to-many architecture.  <img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/12.png" alt=""> So an example of a one-to-many neural network architecture will be music generation. And in fact, you get to implement this yourself in one of the primary exercises for this course where you go is have a neural network, output a set of notes corresponding to a piece of music. And the input x could be maybe just an integer, telling it what genre of music you want or what is the first note of the music you want, and if you don’t want to input anything, x could be a null input, could always be the vector zeroes as well. For that, the neural network architecture would be your input x. And then, have your RNN output. The first value, and then, have that, with no further inputs, output. The second value and then go on to output. The third value, and so on, until you synthesize the last notes of the musical piece. If you want, you can have this input a(0) as well. One technical now what you see in the later video is that, when you’re actually generating sequences, often you take these first synthesized output and feed it to the next layer as well. So the network architecture actually ends up looking like that. So, we’ve talked about many-to- many, many-to-one, one-to-many, as well as one-to-one. It turns out there’s one more interesting example of many-to-many which is worth describing. Which is when the input and the output length are different. So, in the many-to-many example, you saw just now, the input length and the output length have to be exactly the same. For an application like machine translation, the number of words in the input sentence, say a French sentence, and the number of words in the output sentence, say the translation into English, those sentences could be different lengths. So here’s an alternative new network architecture where you might have a neural network, first, reading the sentence. So first, reading the input, say French sentence that you want to translate to English. And having done that, you then, have the neural network output the translation. As all those y hat of (Ty). And so, with this architecture, Tx and Ty can be different lengths. And again, you could draw on the a(0) that you want. And so, this that neural network architecture has two distinct parts. There’s the encoder which takes as input, say a French sentence, and then, there’s is a decoder, which having read in the sentence, outputs the translation into a different language. So this would be an example of a many-to-many architecture. So by the end of this week, you have a good understanding of all the components needed to build these types of architectures. And then, technically, there’s one other architecture which we’ll talk about only in week four, which is attention based architectures. Which maybe isn’t cleanly captured by one of the diagrams we’ve drawn so far. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/13.png" alt=""><br><strong>So, to summarize the wide range of RNN architectures, there is one-to-one, although if it’s one-to-one, we could just give it this, and this is just a standard generic neural network. Well, you don’t need an RNN for this. But there is one-to-many. So, this was a music generation or sequenced generation as example. And then, there’s many-to-one, that would be an example of sentiment classification. Where you might want to read as input all the text with a movie review. And then, try to figure out that they liked the movie or not. There is many-to-many, so the name entity recognition, the example we’ve been using, was this where $T_x$ is equal to $T_y$. And then, finally, there’s this other version of many-to-many, where for applications like machine translation, $T_x$ and $T_y$ no longer have to be the same. So, now you know most of the building blocks, the building are pretty much all of these neural networks except that there are some subtleties with sequence generation, which is what we’ll discuss in the next video</strong>. </p>
<p>So, I hope you saw from this video that using the basic building blocks of an RNN, there’s already a wide range of models that you might be able put together. But as I mentioned, there are some subtleties to sequence generation, which you’ll get to implement yourself as well in this week’s primary exercise where you implement a language model and hopefully, generate some fun sequences or some fun pieces of text. So, what I want to do in the next video, is go deeper into sequence generation. Let’s see the details in the next video.</p>
<h3 id="06-language-model-and-sequence-generation"><a href="#06-language-model-and-sequence-generation" class="headerlink" title="06_language-model-and-sequence-generation"></a>06_language-model-and-sequence-generation</h3><p>Language modeling is one of the most basic and important tasks in natural language processing. There’s also one that RNNs do very well. In this video, you learn about how to build a language model using an RNN, and this will lead up to a fun programming exercise at the end of this week. Where you build a language model and use it to generate Shakespeare-like texting, other types of text. Let’s get started. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/14.png" alt=""><br>So what is a language model? Let’s say you’re building this speech recognition system and you hear the sentence, the apple and pear salad was delicious. So what did you just hear me say? Did I say the apple and pair salad, or did I say the apple and pear salad? You probably think the second sentence is much more likely, and in fact, that’s what a good speech recognition system would help with even though these two sentences sound exactly the same. And the way a speech recognition system picks the second sentence is by using a language model which tells it what the probability is of either of these two sentences. For example, a language model might say that the chance for the first sentence is 3.2 by 10 to the -13. And the chance of the second sentence is say 5.7 by 10 to the -10. And so, with these probabilities, the second sentence is much more likely by over a factor of 10 to the 3 compared to the first sentence. And that’s why speech recognition system will pick the second choice. So what a language model does is given any sentence is job is to tell you what is the probability of a sentence, of that particular sentence. And by probability of sentence I mean, if you want to pick up a random newspaper, open a random email or pick a random webpage or listen to the next thing someone says, the friend of you says. What is the chance that the next sentence you use somewhere out there in the world will be a particular sentence like the apple and pear salad? [COUGH] And this is a fundamental component for both speech recognition systems as you’ve just seen, as well as for machine translation systems where translation systems wants output only sentences that are likely. And so the basic job of a language model is to input a sentence, which I’m going to write as a sequence $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$, $y^{&lt;2&gt;}$ up to $y^{<T_y>}$. And for language model will be useful to represent a sentences as outputs y rather than inputs x. But what the language model does is it estimates the probability of that particular sequence of words. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/15.png" alt=""><br>So how do you build a language model? To build such a model using an RNN you would first need a training set comprising a large <strong>corpus</strong> of english text. Or text from whatever language you want to build a language model of. <strong>And the word corpus is an NLP terminology that just means a large body or a very large set of english text of english sentences</strong>. So let’s say you get a sentence in your training set as follows. Cats average 15 hours of sleep a day. The first thing you would do is tokenize this sentence. And that means you would form a vocabulary as we saw in an earlier video. And then map each of these words to, say, one hot vectors, alter indices in your vocabulary. One thing you might also want to do is model when sentences end. So another common thing to do is to add an extra token called a EOS. That stands for End Of Sentence that can help you figure out when a sentence ends. We’ll talk more about this later, but the EOS token can be appended to the end of every sentence in your training sets if you want your models explicitly capture when sentences end. We won’t use the end of sentence token for the programming exercise at the end of this week where for some applications, you might want to use this. And we’ll see later where this comes in handy. So in this example, we have y1, y2, y3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Nine inputs in this example if you append the end of sentence token to the end. And doing the tokenization step, you can decide whether or not the period should be a token as well. In this example, I’m just ignoring punctuation. So I’m just using day as another token. And omitting the period, if you want to treat the period or other punctuation as explicit token, then you can add the period to you vocabulary as well. Now, one other detail would be what if some of the words in your training set, are not in your vocabulary. So if your vocabulary uses 10,000 words, maybe the 10,000 most common words in English, then the term Mau as in the Egyptian Mau is a breed of cat, that might not be in one of your top 10,000 tokens. So in that case you could take the word Mau and replace it with a unique token called UNK or stands for unknown words and would just model, the chance of the unknown word instead of the specific word now. Having carried out the tokenization step which basically means taking the input sentence and mapping out to the individual tokens or the individual words in your vocabulary. Next let’s build an RNN to model the chance of these different sequences. And one of the things we’ll see on the next slide is that you end up setting the inputs x<t> = y<t-1> or you see that in a little bit. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/16.png" alt=""><br>So let’s go on to built the RNN model and I’m going to continue to use this sentence as the running example. This will be an RNN architecture. At time 0 you’re going to end up computing some activation $a^{&lt;1&gt;}$ as a function of some inputs $x^{&lt;1&gt;}$, and $x^{&lt;1&gt;}$ will just be set it to the set of all zeroes, to 0 vector. And the previous $a^{&lt;0&gt;}$, by convention, also set that to vector zeroes. But what $a^{&lt;1&gt;}$ does is it will make a soft max prediction to try to figure out what is the probability of the first words y. And so that’s going to be $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$. So what this step does is really, it has a soft max it’s trying to predict. What is the probability of any word in the dictionary? That the first one is a, what’s the chance that the first word is Aaron? And then what’s the chance that the first word is cats? All the way to what’s the chance the first word is Zulu? Or what’s the first chance that the first word is an unknown word? Or what’s the first chance that the first word is the in the sentence they’ll have, shouldn’t have to read? Right, so $\hat{y}^{&lt;1&gt;}$ is output to a softmax, it just predicts what’s the chance of the first word being, whatever it ends up being. And in our example, it wind up being the word cats, so this would be a 10,000 way soft max output, if you have a 10,000-word vocabulary. Or 10,002, I guess you could call unknown word and the sentence is two additional tokens. Then, the RNN steps forward to the next step and has some activation, $a^{&lt;1&gt;}$ to the next step. And at this step, his job is try figure out, what is the second word? But now we will also give it the correct first word. So we’ll tell it that, gee, in reality, the first word was actually Cats so that’s $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$. So tell it cats, and this is why $y^{&lt;1&gt;} = x^{&lt;2&gt;}$, and so at the second step the output is again predicted by a soft max. The RNN’s jobs to predict was the chance of a being whatever the word it is. Is it a or Aaron, or Cats or Zulu or unknown whether EOS or whatever given what had come previously. So in this case, I guess the right answer was average since the sentence starts with cats average. And then you go on to the next step of the RNN. Where you now compute $a^{&lt;3&gt;}$. But to predict what is the third word, which is 15, we can now give it the first two words. So we’re going to tell it cats average are the first two words. So this next input here, $x^{&lt;3&gt;} = y^{&lt;2&gt;}$, so the word average is input, and this job is to figure out what is the next word in the sequence. So in other words trying to figure out what is the probability of anywhere than dictionary given that what just came before was cats. Average, right? And in this case, the right answer is 15 and so on. Until at the end, you end up at, I guess, time step 9, you end up feeding it $x^{&lt;9&gt;}$, which is equal to $y^{&lt;8&gt;}$, which is the word, day. And then this has $a^{&lt;9&gt;}$, and its jpob iws to output $\hat{y}^{&lt;9&gt;}$, and this happens to be the EOS token. So what’s the chance of whatever this given, everything that comes before, and hopefully it will predict that there’s a high chance of it, EOS and the sentence token. So each step in the RNN will look at some set of preceding words such as, given the first three words, what is the distribution over the next word? And so this RNN learns to predict one word at a time going from left to right. Next to train us to a network, we’re going to define the cos function. So, at a certain time, t, if the true word was yt and the new networks soft max predicted some $\hat{y}^{<t>}$, then this is the soft max loss function that you should already be familiar with. And then the overall loss is just the sum overall time steps of the loss associated with the individual predictions. And if you train this RNN on the last training set, what you’ll be able to do is given any initial set of words, such as cats average 15 hours of, it can predict what is the chance of the next word. And given a new sentence say, $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$, $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$, $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$with just a three words, for simplicity, the way you can figure out what is the chance of this entire sentence would be. Well, the first soft max tells you what’s the chance of $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$. That would be this first output. And then the second one can tell you what’s the chance of p of $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$ given $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$. And then the third one tells you what’s the chance of $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$ given $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$ and $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$. And so by multiplying out these three probabilities. And you’ll see much more details of this in the previous exercise. By multiply these three, you end up with the probability of the three sentence, of the three-word sentence. </p>
<p>So that’s the basic structure of how you can train a language model using an RNN. If some of these ideas still seem a little bit abstract, don’t worry about it, you get to practice all of these ideas in their program exercise. But next it turns out one of the most fun things you could do with a language model is to sample sequences from the model. Let’s take a look at that in the next video.</p>
<h3 id="07-sampling-novel-sequences"><a href="#07-sampling-novel-sequences" class="headerlink" title="07_sampling-novel-sequences"></a>07_sampling-novel-sequences</h3><p>After you train a sequence model, one of the ways you can informally get a sense of what is learned is to have a sample novel sequences. Let’s take a look at how you could do that. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/17.png" alt=""><br>So remember that a sequence model, models the chance of any particular sequence of words as follows, and so what we like to do is sample from this distribution to generate novel sequences of words. So the network was trained using this structure shown at the top. But to sample, you do something slightly different, so what you want to do is first sample what is the first word you want your model to generate. And so for that you input the usual $x^{&lt;1&gt;}$ equals 0, $a^{&lt;0&gt;}$ equals 0. And now your first time stamp will have some max probability over possible outputs. So what you do is you then randomly sample according to this softmax distribution. So what the soft max distribution gives you is it tells you what is the chance that it refers to this a, what is the chance that it refers to this Aaron? What’s the chance it refers to Zulu, what is the chance that the first word is the Unknown word token. Maybe it was a chance it was a end of sentence token. </p>
<p>And then you take this vector and use, for example, the numpy command <code>np.random.choice</code> to sample according to distribution defined by this vector probabilities, and that lets you sample the first words. Next you then go on to the second time step, and now remember that the second time step is expecting this $\hat{y}^{&lt;1&gt;}$ as input. But what you do is you then take the $\hat{y}^{&lt;1&gt;}$  that you just sampled and pass that in here as the input to the next timestep. So whatever works, you just chose the first time step passes this input in the second position, and then this softmax will make a prediction for what is $\hat{y}^{&lt;2&gt;}$. Example, let’s say that after you sample the first word, the first word happened to be “The”, which is very common choice of first word. Then you pass in “The” as $x^{&lt;2&gt;}$, which is now equal to $\hat{y}^{&lt;1&gt;}$. And now you’re trying to figure out what is the chance of what the second word is given that the first word is d. And this is going to be $\hat{y}^{&lt;2&gt;}$. Then you again use this type of sampling function to sample $\hat{y}^{&lt;2&gt;}$. And then at the next time stamp, you take whatever choice you had represented say as a one hard encoding. And pass that to next timestep and then you sample the third word to that whatever you chose, and you keep going until you get to the last time step. And so how do you know when the sequence ends? Well, one thing you could do is if the end of sentence token is part of your vocabulary, you could keep sampling until you generate an EOS token. And that tells you you’ve hit the end of a sentence and you can stop. Or alternatively, if you do not include this in your vocabulary then you can also just decide to sample 20 words or 100 words or something, and then keep going until you’ve reached that number of time steps. And this particular procedure will sometimes generate an unknown word token. If you want to make sure that your algorithm never generates this token, one thing you could do is just reject any sample that came out as unknown word token and just keep resampling from the rest of the vocabulary until you get a word that’s not an unknown word. Or you can just leave it in the output as well if you don’t mind having an unknown word output. So this is how you would generate a randomly chosen sentence from your RNN language model. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/18.png" alt=""><br>Now, so far we’ve been building a words level RNN, by which I mean the vocabulary are words from English. Depending on your application, one thing you can do is also build a character level RNN. So in this case your vocabulary will just be the alphabets. Up to z, and as well as maybe space, punctuation if you wish, the digits 0 to 9. And if you want to distinguish the uppercase and lowercase, you can include the uppercase alphabets as well, and one thing you can do as you just look at your training set and look at the characters that appears there and use that to define the vocabulary. And if you build a character level language model rather than a word level language model, then your sequence $y^{&lt;1&gt;}, y^{&lt;2&gt;}, y^{&lt;3&gt;}$, would be the individual characters in your training data, rather than the individual words in your training data. So for our previous example, the sentence cats average 15 hours of sleep a day. In this example, c would be $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$, a would be $y^{&lt;2&gt;}$, t will be $y^{&lt;3&gt;}$, the space will be $y^{&lt;4&gt;}$ and so on. Using a character level language model has some pros and cons. One is that you don’t ever have to worry about unknown word tokens. In particular, a character level language model is able to assign a sequence like mau, a non-zero probability. Whereas if mau was not in your vocabulary for the word level language model, you just have to assign it the unknown word token. But the main disadvantage of the character level language model is that you end up with much longer sequences. So many english sentences will have 10 to 20 words but may have many, many dozens of characters. <strong>And so character language models are not as good as word level language models at capturing long range dependencies between how the the earlier parts of the sentence also affect the later part of the sentence. And character level models are also just more computationally expensive to train. So the trend I’ve been seeing in natural language processing is that for the most part, word level language model are still used, but as computers gets faster there are more and more applications where people are, at least in some special cases, starting to look at more character level models. But they tend to be much hardware, much more computationally expensive to train, so they are not in widespread use today</strong>. Except for maybe specialized applications where you might need to deal with unknown words or other vocabulary words a lot. Or they are also used in more specialized applications where you have a more specialized vocabulary. So under these methods, what you can now do is build an RNN to look at the purpose of English text, build a word level, build a character language model, sample from the language model that you’ve trained. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/19.png" alt=""><br>So here are some examples of text thatwere examples from a language model, actually from a culture level language model. And you get to implement something like this yourself in the programming exercise. If the model was trained on news articles, then it generates texts like that shown on the left. And this looks vaguely like news text, not quite grammatical, but maybe sounds a little bit like things that could be appearing news, concussion epidemic to be examined. And it was trained on Shakespearean text and then it generates stuff that sounds like Shakespeare could have written it. The mortal moon hath her eclipse in love. And subject of this thou art another this fold. When besser be my love to me see sabl’s. For whose are ruse of mine eyes heaves. </p>
<p>So that’s it for the basic RNN, and how you can build a language model using it, as well as sample from the language model that you’ve trained. <strong>In the next few videos, I want to discuss further some of the challenges of training RNNs, as well as how to adjust some of these challenges, specifically vanishing gradients by building even more powerful models of the RNN</strong>. So in the next video let’s talk about the problem of vanishing the gradient and we will go on to talk about the GRU, <strong>Gate Recurring Unit as well as the LSTM models</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="08-vanishing-gradients-with-rnns"><a href="#08-vanishing-gradients-with-rnns" class="headerlink" title="08_vanishing-gradients-with-rnns"></a>08_vanishing-gradients-with-rnns</h3><p>You’ve learned about how RNNs work and how they can be applied to problems like name entity recognition, as well as to language modeling, and you saw how backpropagation can be used to train in RNN. It turns out that one of the problems with a basic RNN algorithm is that it runs into vanishing gradient problems. Let’s discuss that, and then in the next few videos, we’ll talk about some solutions that will help to address this problem. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/20.png" alt=""><br>So, you’ve seen pictures of RNNS that look like this. And let’s take a language modeling example. <strong>Let’s say you see this sentence, “The cat which already ate and maybe already ate a bunch of food that was delicious dot, dot, dot, dot, was full.” And so, to be consistent, just because cat is singular, it should be the cat was, were then was, “The cats which already ate a bunch of food was delicious, and apples, and pears, and so on, were full.” So to be consistent, it should be cat was or cats were. And this is one example of when language can have very long-term dependencies, where it worked at this much earlier can affect what needs to come much later in the sentence. But it turns out the basics RNN we’ve seen so far it’s not very good at capturing very long-term dependencies</strong>. To explain why, you might remember from our early discussions of training very deep neural networks, that we talked about the vanishing gradients problem. So this is a very, <strong>very deep neural network</strong> say, 100 layers or even much deeper than you would carry out forward prop, from left to right and then back prop. And we said that, if this is a very deep neural network, then the gradient from just output y, would have a very hard time propagating back to affect the weights of these earlier layers, to affect the computations in the earlier layers. And for an RNN with a similar problem, you have forward prop came from left to right, and then back prop, going from right to left. <strong>And it can be quite difficult, because of the same vanishing gradients problem, for the outputs of the errors associated with the later time steps to affect the computations that are earlier. And so in practice, what this means is, it might be difficult to get a neural network to realize that it needs to memorize the just see a singular noun or a plural noun, so that later on in the sequence that can generate either was or were, depending on whether it was singular or plural. And notice that in English, this stuff in the middle could be arbitrarily long, right? So you might need to memorize the singular/plural for a very long time before you get to use that bit of information. So because of this problem, the basic RNN model has many local influences, meaning that the output $y^{&lt;3&gt;}$ is mainly influenced by values close to $y^{&lt;3&gt;}$. And a value here is mainly influenced by inputs that are somewhere close. And it’s difficult for the output here to be strongly influenced by an input that was very early in the sequence. And this is because whatever the output is, whether this got it right, this got it wrong, it’s just very difficult for the area to backpropagate all the way to the beginning of the sequence, and therefore to modify how the neural network is doing computations earlier in the sequence. So this is a weakness of the basic RNN algorithm</strong>. One, which was not addressed in the next few videos. But if we don’t address it, then RNNs tend not to be very good at capturing long-range dependencies. And even though this discussion has focused on vanishing gradients, you will remember when we talked about very deep neural networks, that we also talked about exploding gradients. We’re doing back prop, the gradients should not just decrease exponentially, they may also increase exponentially with the number of layers you go through. It turns out that vanishing gradients tends to be the bigger problem with training RNNs, although when exploding gradients happens, it can be catastrophic because the exponentially large gradients can cause your parameters to become so large that your neural network parameters get really messed up. So it turns out that exploding gradients are easier to spot because the parameters just blow up and you might often see NaNs, or not a numbers, meaning results of a numerical overflow in your neural network computation. <strong>And if you do see exploding gradients, one solution to that is apply gradient clipping</strong>. And what that really means, all that means is look at your gradient vectors, and if it is bigger than some threshold, re-scale some of your gradient vector so that is not too big. So there are clips according to some maximum value. So if you see exploding gradients, if your derivatives do explode or you see NaNs, just apply gradient clipping, and <strong>that’s a relatively robust solution that will take care of exploding gradients. But vanishing gradients is much harder to solve and it will be the subject of the next few videos</strong>. </p>
<p>So to summarize, in an earlier course, you saw how the training of very deep neural network, you can run into a vanishing gradient or exploding gradient problems with the derivative, either decreases exponentially or grows exponentially as a function of the number of layers. And in RNN, say in RNN processing data over a thousand times sets, over 10,000 times sets, that’s basically a 1,000 layer or they go 10,000 layer neural network, and so, it too runs into these types of problems. Exploding gradients, you could sort of address by just using gradient clipping, but vanishing gradients will take more work to address. <strong>So what we do in the next video is talk about GRU, the greater recurrent units, which is a very effective solution for addressing the vanishing gradient problem and will allow your neural network to capture much longer range dependencies</strong>. So, lets go on to the next video.</p>
<h3 id="09-gated-recurrent-unit-gru"><a href="#09-gated-recurrent-unit-gru" class="headerlink" title="09_gated-recurrent-unit-gru"></a>09_gated-recurrent-unit-gru</h3><p>You’ve seen how a basic RNN works. In this video, you learn about <strong>the Gated Recurrent Unit which is a modification to the RNN hidden layer that makes it much better capturing long range connections and helps a lot with the vanishing gradient problems</strong>. Let’s take a look. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/21.png" alt=""><br>You’ve already seen the formula for computing the activations at time t of RNN. It’s the activation function applied to the parameter Wa times the activations in the previous time set, the current input and then plus ba. So I’m going to draw this as a picture. So the RNN unit, I’m going to draw as a picture, drawn as a box which inputs a of t-1, the activation for the last time-step. And also inputs x<t> and these two go together. And after some weights and after this type of linear calculation, if g is a tanh activation function, then after the tanh, it computes the output activation a. And the output activation a(t) might also be passed to say a softener unit or something that could then be used to output y<t>. So this is maybe a visualization of the RNN unit of the hidden layer of the RNN in terms of a picture. And I want to show you this picture because we’re going to use a similar picture to explain the GRU or the Gated Recurrent Unit. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/22.png" alt=""><br>Lots of the idea of GRU were due to these two papers respectively by Yu Young Chang, Kagawa, Gaza Hera, Chang Hung Chu and Jose Banjo. And I’m sometimes going to refer to this sentence which we’d seen in the last video to motivate that. Given a sentence like this, you might need to remember the cat was singular, to make sure you understand why that was rather than were. So the cat was for or the cats were for. So as we read in this sentence from left to right, the GRU unit is going to have a new variable called <strong>c, which stands for cell, for memory cell</strong>. And what the memory cell do is it will provide a bit of memory to remember, for example, whether cat was singular or plural, so that when it gets much further into the sentence it can still work under consideration whether the subject of the sentence was singular or plural. And so at time t the memory cell will have some value c of t. And what we see is that the GRU unit will actually output an activation value a of t that’s equal to c of t. And for now I wanted to use different symbol c and a to denote the memory cell value and the output activation value, even though they are the same. I’m using this notation because when we talk about LSTMs, a little bit later, these will be two different values. But for now, for the GRU, c of t is equal to the output activation a of t. So these are the equations that govern the computations of a GRU unit. <strong>And every time-step, we’re going to consider overwriting the memory cell with a value c tilde of t. So this is going to be a candidate for replacing c of t</strong>. And we’re going to compute this using an activation function tanh of Wc. And so that’s the parameter to make sure it’s Wc and we’ll plus this parameter matrix, the previous value of the memory cell, the activation value as well as the current input value $x^{<t>}$, and then plus the bias. So c tilde of t is going to be a candidate for replacing $c^{<t>}$. And then the key, really the important idea of the GRU it will be that we have a gate. So the gate, I’m going to call gamma u. This is the capital Greek alphabet gamma subscript u, and u stands for update gate, and this will be a value between zero and one. And to develop your intuition about how GRUs work, think of gamma u, this gate value, as being always zero or one. Although in practice, your compute it with a sigmoid function applied to this. So remember that the sigmoid function looks like this. And so it’s value is always between zero and one. And for most of the possible ranges of the input, the sigmoid function is either very, very close to zero or very, very close to one. So for intuition, think of gamma as being either zero or one most of the time. And this alphabet u stands for- I chose the alphabet gamma for this because if you look at a gate fence, looks a bit like this I guess, then there are a lot of gammas in this fence. So that’s why gamma u, we’re going to use to denote the gate. Also Greek alphabet G, right. G for gate. So G for gamma and G for gate. <strong>And then next, the key part of the GRU is this equation which is that we have come up with a candidate where we’re thinking of updating c using c tilde, and then the gate will decide whether or not we actually update it</strong>. And so the way to think about it is maybe this memory cell c is going to be set to either zero or one depending on whether the word you are considering, really the subject of the sentence is singular or plural. So because it’s singular, let’s say that we set this to one. And if it was plural, maybe we would set this to zero, and then the GRU unit would memorize the value of the $c^{<t>}$ all the way until here, where this is still equal to one and so that tells it, oh, it’s singular so use the choice was. And the job of the gate, of gamma u, is to decide when do you update these values. In particular, when you see the phrase, the cat, you know they you’re talking about a new concept the especially subject of the sentence cat. So that would be a good time to update this bit and then maybe when you’re done using it, the cat blah blah blah was full, then you know, okay, I don’t need to memorize anymore, I can just forget that. So the specific equation we’ll use for the GRU is the following. Which is that the actual value of $c^{<t>}$ will be equal to this gate times the candidate value plus one minus the gate times the old value, $c^{<t-1>}$. So you notice that if the gate, if this update value, this equal to one, then it’s saying set the new value of $c^{<t>}$ equal to this candidate value. So that’s like over here, set gate equal to one so go ahead and update that bit. And then for all of these values in the middle, you should have the gate equals zero. So this is saying don’t update it, don’t update it, don’t update it, just hang onto the old value. Because if gamma u is equal to zero, then this would be zero, and this would be one. And so it’s just setting $c^{<t>}$ equal to the old value, even as you scan the sentence from left to right. So when the gate is equal to zero, we’re saying don’t update it, don’t update it, just hang on to the value and don’t forget what this value was. And so that way even when you get all the way down here, hopefully you’ve just been setting $c^{<t>}$ equals $c^{<t-1>}$ all along. And it still memorizes, the cat was singular. So let me also draw a picture to denote the GRU unit. And by the way, when you look in online blog posts and textbooks and tutorials these types of pictures are quite popular for explaining GRUs as well as we’ll see later, LSTM units. I personally find the equations easier to understand in a pictures. So if the picture doesn’t make sense. Don’t worry about it, but I’ll just draw in case helps some of you. So a GRU unit inputs $c^{<t-1>}$, for the previous time-step and just happens to be equal to 80 minus one. So take that as input and then it also takes as input $x^{<t>}$, then these two things get combined together. And with some appropriate weighting and some tanh, this gives you c tilde t which is a candidate for placing $c^{<t>}$, and then with a different set of parameters and through a sigmoid activation function, this gives you gamma u, which is the update gate. And then finally, all of these things combine together through another operation. And I won’t write out the formula, but this box here which wish I shaded in purple represents this equation which we had down there. So that’s what this purple operation represents. And it takes as input the gate value, the candidate new value, or there is this gate value again and the old value for $c^{<t>}$, right. So it takes as input this, this and this and together they generate the new value for the memory cell. And so that’s $c^{<t>}$ equals a. And if you wish you could also use this process to soft max or something to make some prediction for $y^{<t>}$. So that is the GRU unit or at least a slightly simplified version of it. And what is remarkably good at is through the gates deciding that when you’re scanning the sentence from left to right say, that’s a good time to update one particular memory cell and then to not change, not change it until you get to the point where you really need it to use this memory cell that is set even earlier in the sentence. And because the sigmoid value, now, because the gate is quite easy to set to zero right. So long as this quantity is a large negative value, then up to numerical around off the uptake gate will be essentially zero. Very, very, very close to zero. So when that’s the case, then this updated equation and subsetting $c^{<t>}$ equals $c^{<t-1>}$. And so this is very good at maintaining the value for the cell. And because gamma can be so close to zero, can be 0.000001 or even smaller than that, it doesn’t suffer from much of a vanishing gradient problem. Because when you say gamma so close to zero this becomes essentially $c^{<t>}$ equals $c^{<t-1>}$ and the value of $c^{<t>}$ is maintained pretty much exactly even across many many many many time-steps. So this can help significantly with the vanishing gradient problem and therefore allow a neural network to go on even very long range dependencies, such as a cat and was related even if they’re separated by a lot of words in the middle. </p>
<p>Now I just want to talk over some more details of how you implement this. In the equations I’ve written, $c^{<t>}$ can be a vector. So if you have 100 dimensional or hidden activation value then $c^{<t>}$ can be a 100 dimensional say. And so $\tilde{c}^{<t>}$ would also be the same dimension, and gamma would also be the same dimension as the other things on drawing boxes. And in that case, these asterisks are actually element wise multiplication. So here if gamma u, if the gate is 100 dimensional vector, what it is really a 100 dimensional vector of bits, the value is mostly zero and one. That tells you of this 100 dimensional memory cell which are the bits you want to update. And, of course, in practice gamma won’t be exactly zero or one. Sometimes it takes values in the middle as well but it is convenient for intuition to think of it as mostly taking on values that are exactly zero, pretty much exactly zero or pretty much exactly one. And what these element wise multiplications do is it just element wise tells the GRU unit which other bits in your- It just tells your GRU which are the dimensions of your memory cell vector to update at every time-step. So you can choose to keep some bits constant while updating other bits. So, for example, maybe you use one bit to remember the singular or plural cat and maybe use some other bits to realize that you’re talking about food. And so because you’re talk about eating and talk about food, then you’d expect to talk about whether the cat is four letter, right. You can use different bits and change only a subset of the bits every point in time. You now understand the most important ideas of the GRU. What I’m presenting in this slide is actually a slightly simplified GRU unit. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/23.png" alt=""><br>Let me describe the full GRU unit. So to do that, let me copy the three main equations. This one, this one and this one to the next slide. So here they are. And for the full GRU unit, I’m sure to make one change to this which is, for the first equation which was calculating the candidate new value for the memory cell, I’m going just to add one term. Let me pushed that a little bit to the right, and I’m going to add one more gate. So this is another gate $\Gamma_r$. You can think of r as standing for relevance. So this gate $\Gamma_r$ tells you how relevant is $c^{<t-1>}$ to computing the next candidate for $c^{<t>}$. And this gate $\Gamma_r$ is computed pretty much as you’d expect with a new parameter matrix $W_r$, and then the same things as input $x^{<t>}$ plus $b_r$. So <strong>as you can imagine there are multiple ways to design these types of neural networks. And why do we have $\Gamma_r$ ? Why not use a simpler version from the previous slides? So it turns out that over many years researchers have experimented with many, many different possible versions of how to design these units, to try to have longer range connections, to try to have more the longer range effects and also address vanishing gradient problems. And the GRU is one of the most commonly used versions that researchers have converged to and found as robust and useful for many different problems. If you wish you could try to invent new versions of these units if you want, but the GRU is a standard one, that’s just common used. Although you can imagine that researchers have tried other versions that are similar but not exactly the same as what I’m writing down here as well. And the other common version is called an LSTM which stands for Long Short Term Memory which we’ll talk about in the next video. But GRUs and LSTMs are two specific instantiations of this set of ideas that are most commonly used</strong>. Just one note on notation. I tried to define a consistent notation to make these ideas easier to understand. If you look at the academic literature, you sometimes see people- If you look at the academic literature sometimes you see people using alternative notation to be $\tilde{x}$, u, r and h to refer to these quantities as well. But I try to use a more consistent notation between GRUs and LSTMs as well as using a more consistent notation gamma to refer to the gates, so hopefully make these ideas easier to understand. </p>
<p>So that’s it for the GRU, for the Gate Recurrent Unit. This is one of the ideas in RNN that has enabled them to become much better at capturing very long range dependencies has made RNN much more effective. Next, as I briefly mentioned, the other most commonly used variation of this class of idea is something called the LSTM unit, Long Short Term Memory unit. Let’s take a look at that in the next video.</p>
<h3 id="10-long-short-term-memory-lstm"><a href="#10-long-short-term-memory-lstm" class="headerlink" title="10_long-short-term-memory-lstm"></a>10_long-short-term-memory-lstm</h3><p>In the last video, you learned about the GRU, the gated recurrent units, and how that can allow you to learn very long range connections in a sequence. The other type of unit that allows you to do this very well is the LSTM or the long short term memory units, and this is even more powerful than the GRU. Let’s take a look. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/24.png" alt=""><br>Here are the equations from the previous video for the GRU. And for the GRU, we had $a^{<t>}$ equals $c^{<t>}$, and two gates, the optic gate and the relevance gate, $\tilde{c}^{<t>}$, which is a candidate for replacing the memory cell, and then we use the <strong>update gate</strong>, $\Gamma_u$, to decide whether or not to update $c^{<t>}$ using $\tilde{c}^{<t>}$. The LSTM is an even slightly more powerful and more general version of the GRU, and is due to Sepp Hochreiter and Jurgen Schmidhuber. And this was a really seminal paper, a huge impact on sequence modelling. I think this paper is one of the more difficult to read. It goes quite along into theory of vanishing gradients. And so, I think more people have learned about the details of LSTM through maybe other places than from this particular paper even though I think this paper has had a wonderful impact on the Deep Learning community. But these are the equations that govern the LSTM. So, the book continued to the memory cell, c, and the candidate value for updating it, $\tilde{c}^{<t>}$, will be this, and so on. Notice that for the LSTM, we will no longer have the case that $a^{<t>}$ is equal to $c^{<t>}$. So, this is what we use. And so, this is just like the equation on the left except that with now, more specially use $a^{<t>}$ there or $a^{<t-1>}$ instead of $c^{<t-1>}$. And we’re not using this gamma or this relevance gate. Although you could have a variation of the LSTM where you put that back in, but with the more common version of the LSTM, doesn’t bother with that. And then we will have an update gate, same as before. So, W updates and we’re going to use $a^{<t-1>}$ here, $x^{<t>}$ plus $b_u$. And one new property of the LSTM is, instead of having one update gate control, both of these terms, we’re going to have two separate terms. So instead of $\Gamma_u$ and one minus $\Gamma_u$, we’re going have $\Gamma_u$ here. And <strong>forget gate</strong>, which we’re going to call $\Gamma_f$. So, this gate, $\Gamma_f$, is going to be sigmoid of pretty much what you’d expect, $x^{<t>}$ plus $b_f$. And then, we’re going to have a new output gate which is sigma of $W_o$. And then again, pretty much what you’d expect, plus $b_o$. And then, the update value to the memory so will be $c^{<t>}$ equals $\Gamma_u$. And this asterisk denotes element-wise multiplication. This is a vector-vector element-wise multiplication, plus, and instead of one minus $\Gamma_u$, we’re going to have a separate forget gate, $\Gamma_f$, times c of t minus one. So this gives the memory cell the option of keeping the old value $c^{<t>}$ minus one and then just adding to it, this new value, $\tilde{c}^{<t>}$. So, use a separate update and forget gates. So, this stands for update, forget, and output gate. And then finally, instead of $a^{<t>}$ equals $c^{<t>}$ $a^{<t>}$ is $a^{<t>}$ equal to the output gate element-wise multiplied by $c^{<t>}$. So, these are the equations that govern the LSTM and you can tell it has three gates instead of two. So, it’s a bit more complicated and it places the gates into slightly different places. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/25.png" alt=""><br>So, here again are the equations governing the behavior of the LSTM. Once again, it’s traditional to explain these things using pictures. So let me draw one here. And if these pictures are too complicated, don’t worry about it. I personally find the equations easier to understand than the picture. But I’ll just show the picture here for the intuitions it conveys. The bigger picture here was very much inspired by a blog post due to Chris Ola, title, Understanding LSTM Network, and the diagram drawing here is quite similar to one that he drew in his blog post. But the key thing is to take away from this picture are maybe that you use $a^{<t-1>}$ and $x^{<t>}$ to compute all the gate values. In this picture, you have $a^{<t-1>}$, $x^{<t>}$ coming together to compute the forget gate, to compute the update gates, and to compute output gate. And they also go through a tanh to compute $\tilde{c}^{<t>}$. And then these values are combined in these complicated ways with element-wise multiplies and so on, to get $c^{<t>}$ from the previous $c^{<t-1>}$. Now, one element of this is interesting as you have a bunch of these in parallel. So, that’s one of them and you connect them. You then connect these temporally. So it does the input $x^{&lt;1&gt;}$ then $x^{&lt;2&gt;}$, $x^{&lt;3&gt;}$. So, you can take these units and just hold them up as follows, where the output a at the previous timestep is the input a at the next timestep, the c. I’ve simplified to diagrams a little bit in the bottom. <strong>And one cool thing about this you’ll notice is that there’s this line at the top that shows how, so long as you set the forget and the update gate appropriately, it is relatively easy for the LSTM to have some value $c^{&lt;0&gt;}$ and have that be passed all the way to the right to have your, maybe, $c^{&lt;3&gt;}$ equals $c^{&lt;0&gt;}$. And this is why the LSTM, as well as the GRU, is very good at memorizing certain values even for a long time, for certain real values stored in the memory cell even for many, many timesteps</strong>. So, that’s it for the LSTM. As you can imagine, there are also a few variations on this that people use. Perhaps, the most common one is that instead of just having the gate values be dependent only on $a^{<t-1>}$, $x^{<t>}$, sometimes, people also sneak in there the values $c^{<t-1>}$ as well. This is called a peephole connection. Not a great name maybe but you’ll see, peephole connection. What that means is that the gate values may depend not just on $a^{<t-1>}$ and on $x^{<t>}$, but also on the previous memory cell value, and the peephole connection can go into all three of these gates’ computations. So that’s one common variation you see of LSTMs. One technical detail is that these are, say, 100-dimensional vectors. So if you have a 100-dimensional hidden memory cell unit, and so is this. And the, say, fifth element of $c^{<t-1>}$ affects only the fifth element of the corresponding gates, so that relationship is one-to-one, where not every element of the 100-dimensional $c^{<t-1>}$ can affect all elements of the case. But instead, the first element of $c^{<t-1>}$ affects the first element of the case, second element affects the second element, and so on. But if you ever read the paper and see someone talk about the peephole connection, that’s when they mean that $c^{<t-1>}$ is used to affect the gate value as well. </p>
<p>So, that’s it for the LSTM. <strong>When should you use a GRU? And when should you use an LSTM</strong>? There isn’t widespread consensus in this. And even though I presented GRUs first, in the history of deep learning, LSTMs actually came much earlier, and then GRUs were relatively recent invention that were maybe derived as Pavia’s simplification of the more complicated LSTM model. Researchers have tried both of these models on many different problems, and on different problems, different algorithms will win out. <strong>So, there isn’t a universally-superior algorithm which is why I want to show you both of them. But I feel like when I am using these, the advantage of the GRU is that it’s a simpler model and so it is actually easier to build a much bigger network, it only has two gates, so computationally, it runs a bit faster. So, it scales the building somewhat bigger models but the LSTM is more powerful and more effective since it has three gates instead of two. If you want to pick one to use, I think LSTM has been the historically more proven choice. So, if you had to pick one, I think most people today will still use the LSTM as the default first thing to try. Although, I think in the last few years, GRUs had been gaining a lot of momentum and I feel like more and more teams are also using GRUs because they’re a bit simpler but often work just as well. It might be easier to scale them to even bigger problems</strong>. So, that’s it for LSTMs. Well, either GRUs or LSTMs, you’ll be able to build neural network that can capture a much longer range dependancy.</p>
<h3 id="11-bidirectional-rnn"><a href="#11-bidirectional-rnn" class="headerlink" title="11_bidirectional-rnn"></a>11_bidirectional-rnn</h3><p>By now, you’ve seen most of the cheap building blocks of RNNs. But, there are just two more ideas that let you build much more powerful models. One is bidirectional RNNs, which lets you at a point in time to take information from both earlier and later in the sequence, so we’ll talk about that in this video. And second, is deep RNNs, which you’ll see in the next video. So let’s start with Bidirectional RNNs. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/26.png" alt=""><br>So, to motivate bidirectional RNNs, let’s look at this network which you’ve seen a few times before in the context of named entity recognition. And one of the problems of this network is that, to figure out whether the third word Teddy is a part of the person’s name, it’s not enough to just look at the first part of the sentence. So to tell, if Y three should be zero or one, you need more information than just the first three words because the first three words doesn’t tell you if they’ll talking about Teddy bears or talk about the former US president, Teddy Roosevelt. So this is a unidirectional or forward directional only RNN. And, this comment I just made is true, whether these cells are standard RNN blocks or whether they’re GRU units or whether they’re LSTM blocks. But all of these blocks are in a forward only direction. So what a bidirectional RNN does or BRNN, is fix this issue. So, a bidirectional RNN works as follows. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/27.png" alt=""><br>I’m going to use a simplified four inputs or maybe a four word sentence. So we have four inputs. X one through X four. So this networks heading there will have a forward recurrent components. So I’m going to call this, A one, A two, A three and A four, and I’m going to draw a right arrow over that to denote this is the forward recurrent component, and so they’ll be connected as follows. And so, each of these four recurrent units inputs the current X, and then feeds in to help predict Y-hat one, Y-hat two, Y-hat three, and Y-hat four. So, so far I haven’t done anything. Basically, we’ve drawn the RNN from the previous slide, but with the arrows placed in slightly funny positions. But I drew the arrows in this slightly funny positions because what we’re going to do is add a backward recurrent layer. So we’d have A one, left arrow to denote this is a backward connection, and then A two, backwards, A three, backwards and A four, backwards, so the left arrow denotes that it is a backward connection. And so, we’re then going to connect to network up as follows. And this A backward connections will be connected to each other going backward in time. So, notice that this network defines a Acyclic graph. And so, given an input sequence, X one through X four, the fourth sequence will first compute A forward one, then use that to compute A forward two, then A forward three, then A forward four. Whereas, the backward sequence would start by computing A backward four, and then go back and compute A backward three, and then as you are computing network activation, this is not backward this is forward prop. But the forward prop has part of the computation going from left to right and part of computation going from right to left in this diagram. But having computed A backward three, you can then use those activations to compute A backward two, and then A backward one, and then finally having computed all you had in the activations, you can then make your predictions. And so, for example, to make the predictions, your network will have something like Y-hat at time t is an activation function applied to WY with both the forward activation at time t, and the backward activation at time t being fed in to make that prediction at time t. So, if you look at the prediction at time set three for example, then information from X one can flow through here, forward one to forward two, they’re are all stated in the function here, to forward three to Y-hat three. So information from X one, X two, X three are all taken into account with information from X four can flow through a backward four to a backward three to Y three. So this allows the prediction at time three to take as input both information from the past, as well as information from the present which goes into both the forward and the backward things at this step, as well as information from the future. So, in particular, given a phrase like, “He said, Teddy Roosevelt…” To predict whether Teddy is a part of the person’s name, you take into account information from the past and from the future. So this is the bidirectional recurrent neural network and these blocks here can be not just the standard RNN block but they can also be GRU blocks or LSTM blocks. In fact, for a lots of NLP problems, for a lot of text with natural language processing problems, a bidirectional RNN with a LSTM appears to be commonly used. So, we have NLP problem and you have the complete sentence, you try to label things in the sentence, a bidirectional RNN with LSTM blocks both forward and backward would be a pretty views of first thing to try. <strong>So, that’s it for the bidirectional RNN and this is a modification they can make to the basic RNN architecture or the GRU or the LSTM, and by making this change you can have a model that uses RNN and or GRU or LSTM and is able to make predictions anywhere even in the middle of a sequence by taking into account information potentially from the entire sequence. The disadvantage of the bidirectional RNN is that you do need the entire sequence of data before you can make predictions anywhere</strong>. So, for example, if you’re building a speech recognition system, then the BRNN will let you take into account the entire speech utterance but if you use this straightforward implementation, you need to wait for the person to stop talking to get the entire utterance before you can actually process it and make a speech recognition prediction. So for a real type speech recognition applications, they’re somewhat more complex modules as well rather than just using the standard bidirectional RNN as you’ve seen here. But for a lot of natural language processing applications where you can get the entire sentence all the same time, the standard BRNN algorithm is actually very effective. </p>
<p>So, that’s it for BRNNs and next and final video for this week, let’s talk about how to take all of these ideas RNNs, LSTMs and GRUs and the bidirectional versions and construct deep versions of them.</p>
<h3 id="12-deep-rnns"><a href="#12-deep-rnns" class="headerlink" title="12_deep-rnns"></a>12_deep-rnns</h3><p>The different versions of RNNs you’ve seen so far will already work quite well by themselves. But for learning very complex functions sometimes is useful to stack multiple layers of RNNs together to build even deeper versions of these models. In this video, you’ll see how to build these deeper RNNs. Let’s take a look. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/28.png" alt=""><br>So you remember for a standard neural network, you will have an input X. And then that’s stacked to some hidden layer and so that might have activations of say, $a^{&lt;1&gt;}$ for the first hidden layer, and then that’s stacked to the next layer with activations $a^{&lt;2&gt;}$, then maybe another layer, activations $a^{&lt;3&gt;}$ and then you make a prediction $ŷ$. So a deep RNN is a bit like this, by taking this network that I just drew by hand and unrolling that in time. So let’s take a look. So here’s the standard RNN that you’ve seen so far. But I’ve changed the notation a little bit which is that, instead of writing this as $a^{&lt;0&gt;}$ for the activation time zero, I’ve added this square bracket 1 to denote that this is for layer one. So the notation we’re going to use is $a^{[l]}$ to denote that it’s an activation associated with layer l and then <t> to denote that that’s associated over time t. So this will have an activation on $a^{[1]&lt;1&gt;}$, this would be $a^{[1]&lt;2&gt;}$, $a^{[1]&lt;3&gt;}$, $a^{[1]&lt;4&gt;}$. And then we can just stack these things on top and so this will be a new network with three hidden layers. So let’s look at an example of how this value is computed. So $a^{[2]&lt;3&gt;}$ has two inputs. It has the input coming from the bottom, and there’s the input coming from the left. So the computer has an activation function g applied to a weight matrix. This is going to be $W_a$ because computing an a quantity, an activation quantity. And for the second layer, and so I’m going to give this $a^{[2]&lt;2&gt;}$, there’s that thing, comma $a^{[1]&lt;3&gt;}$, there’s that thing, plus $b_a$ associated to the second layer. And that’s how you get that activation value. And so the same parameters $W_a^{[2]}$ and $b_a^{[2]}$ are used for every one of these computations at this layer. Whereas, in contrast, the first layer would have its own parameters $W_a^{[1]}$ and $b_a^{[1]}$. <strong>So whereas for standard RNNs like the one on the left, you know we’ve seen neural networks that are very, very deep, maybe over 100 layers. For RNNs, having three layers is already quite a lot. Because of the temporal dimension, these networks can already get quite big even if you have just a small handful of layers. And you don’t usually see these stacked up to be like 100 layers</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/nlp-sequence-models/lectures/week1/images/29.png" alt=""><br>One thing you do see sometimes is that you have recurrent layers that are stacked on top of each other. But then you might take the output here, let’s get rid of this, and then just have a bunch of deep layers that are not connected horizontally but have a deep network here that then finally predicts $y^{&lt;1&gt;}$. And you can have the same deep network here that predicts $y^{&lt;2&gt;}$. So this is a type of network architecture that we’re seeing a little bit more where you have three recurrent units that connected in time, followed by a network, followed by a network after that, as we seen for $y^{&lt;3&gt;}$ and $y^{&lt;4&gt;}$, of course. <strong>There’s a deep network, but that does not have the horizontal connections. So that’s one type of architecture we seem to be seeing more of. And quite often, these blocks don’t just have to be standard RNN, the simple RNN model. They can also be GRU blocks LSTM blocks. And finally, you can also build deep versions of the bidirectional RNN. Because deep RNNs are quite computationally expensive to train, there’s often a large temporal extent already, though you just don’t see as many deep recurrent layers</strong>. This has, I guess, three deep recurrent layers that are connected in time. You don’t see as many deep recurrent layers as you would see in a number of layers in a deep conventional neural network. </p>
<p>So that’s it for deep RNNs. With what you’ve seen this week, ranging from the basic RNN, the basic recurrent unit, to the GRU, to the LSTM, to the bidirectional RNN, to the deep versions of this that you just saw, you now have a very rich toolbox for constructing very powerful models for learning sequence models. I hope you enjoyed this week’s videos. Best of luck with the problem exercises and I look forward to seeing you next week.</p>

          <h2 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h2><p>This is my personal note after studying the course of the 4th week <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convolutional neural networks</a> and the copyright belongs to <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeplearning.ai</a>.</p>

By now, you’ve learned a lot about confidence. What I want to do this week is show you a couple important special applications of confidence. We’ll start the face recognition, and then go on later this week to neurosal transfer, which you get to implement in the problem exercise as well to create your own artwork. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/1.png" alt=""><br>But first, let’s start the face recognition and just for fun, I want to show you a demo. When I was leading by those AI group, one of the teams I worked with led by Yuanqing Lin had built a face recognition system that I thought is really cool. Let’s take a look. So, I’m going to play this video here, but I can also get whoever is editing this raw video configure out to this better to splice in the raw video or take the one I’m playing here. I want to show you a face recognition demo. I’m in Baidu’s headquarters in China. Most companies require that to get inside, you swipe an ID card like this one but here we don’t need that. Using face recognition, check what I can do. When I walk up, it recognizes my face, it says, “Welcome Andrew,” and I just walk right through without ever having to use my ID card. Let me show you something else. I’m actually here with Lin Yuanqing, the director of IDL which developed all of this face recognition technology. I’m gonna hand him my ID card, which has my face printed on it, and he’s going to use it to try to sneak in using my picture instead of a live human. I’m gonna use Andrew’s card and try to sneak in and see what happens. So the system is not recognizing it, it refuses to recognize. Okay. Now, I’m going to use my own face. So face recognition technology like this is taking off very rapidly in China and I hope that this type of technology soon makes it way to other countries.. So, pretty cool, right? The video you just saw demoed both face recognition as well as liveness detection. The latter meaning making sure that you are a live human. It turns out liveness detection can be implemented using supervised learning as well to predict live human versus not live human but I want to spend less time on that. Instead, I want to focus our time on talking about how to build the face recognition portion of the system. First, let’s start by going over some of the terminology used in face recognition. In the face recognition literature, people often talk about face verification and face recognition. This is the face verification problem which is if you’re given an input image as well as a name or ID of a person and the job of the system is to verify whether or not the input image is that of the claimed person. So, sometimes this is also called a one to one problem where you just want to know if the person is the person they claim to be. So, the recognition problem is much harder than the verification problem. To see why, let’s say, you have a verification system that’s 99 percent accurate. So, 99 percent might not be too bad but now suppose that K is equal to 100 in a recognition system. If you apply this system to a recognition task with a 100 people in your database, you now have a hundred times of chance of making a mistake and if the chance of making mistakes on each person is just one percent. So, if you have a database of a 100 persons and if you want an acceptable recognition error, you might actually need a verification system with maybe 99.9 or even higher accuracy before you can run it on a database of 100 persons that have a high chance and still have a high chance of getting incorrect. In fact, if you have a database of 100 persons currently just be even quite a bit higher than 99 percent for that to work well. <strong>But what we do in the next few videos is focus on building a face verification system as a building block and then if the accuracy is high enough, then you probably use that in a recognition system as well</strong>. </p>
<p>So in the next video, we’ll start describing how you can build a face verification system. It turns out one of the reasons that is a difficult problem is you need to solve a one shot learning problem. Let’s see in the next video what that means.</p>
<h3 id="02-one-shot-learning"><a href="#02-one-shot-learning" class="headerlink" title="02_one-shot-learning"></a>02_one-shot-learning</h3><p>One of the challenges of face recognition is that you need to solve the one-shot learning problem. What that means is that for most face recognition applications you need to be able to recognize a person given just one single image, or given just one example of that person’s face. And, historically, deep learning algorithms don’t work well if you have only one training example. Let’s see an example of what this means and talk about how to address this problem. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/2.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say you have a database of four pictures of employees in you’re organization. These are actually some of my colleagues at Deeplearning.AI, Khan, Danielle, Younes and Thian. Now let’s say someone shows up at the office and they want to be let through the turnstile. What the system has to do is, despite ever having seen only one image of Danielle, to recognize that this is actually the same person. And, in contrast, if it sees someone that’s not in this database, then it should recognize that this is not any of the four persons in the database. So in the one shot learning problem, you have to learn from just one example to recognize the person again. And you need this for most face recognition systems because you might have only one picture of each of your employees or of your team members in your employee database. So one approach you could try is to input the image of the person, feed it too a ConvNet. And have it output a label, y, using a softmax unit with four outputs or maybe five outputs corresponding to each of these four persons or none of the above. So that would be 5 outputs in the softmax. But this really doesn’t work well. Because if you have such a small training set it is really not enough to train a robust neural network for this task. And also what if a new person joins your team? So now you have 5 persons you need to recognize, so there should now be six outputs. Do you have to retrain the ConvNet every time? That just doesn’t seem like a good approach. So to carry out face recognition, to carry out one-shot learning. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/3.png" alt=""><br>So instead, to make this work, what you’re going to do instead is learn a similarity function. In particular, you want a neural network to learn a function which going to denote d, which inputs two images and outputs the degree of difference between the two images. So if the two images are of the same person, you want this to output a small number. And if the two images are of two very different people you want it to output a large number. So during recognition time, if the degree of difference between them is less than some threshold called tau, which is a hyperparameter. Then you would predict that these two pictures are the same person. And if it is greater than tau, you would predict that these are different persons. And so this is how you address the face verification problem. To use this for a recognition task, what you do is, given this new picture, you will use this function d to compare these two images. And maybe I’ll output a very large number, let’s say 10, for this example. And then you compare this with the second image in your database. And because these two are the same person, hopefully you output a very small number. You do this for the other images in your database and so on. And based on this, you would figure out that this is actually that person, which is Danielle. And in contrast, if someone not in your database shows up, as you use the function d to make all of these pairwise comparisons, hopefully d will output have a very large number for all four pairwise comparisons. And then you say that this is not any one of the four persons in the database. Notice how this allows you to solve the one-shot learning problem. So long as you can learn this function d, which inputs a pair of images and tells you, basically, if they’re the same person or different persons. Then if you have someone new join your team, you can add a fifth person to your database, and it just works fine. </p>
<p>So you’ve seen how learning this function d, which inputs two images, allows you to address the one-shot learning problem. In the next video, let’s take a look at how you can actually train the neural network to learn dysfunction d.</p>
<h3 id="03-siamese-network"><a href="#03-siamese-network" class="headerlink" title="03_siamese-network"></a>03_siamese-network</h3><p>The job of the function d, which you learned about in the last video, is to input two faces and tell you how similar or how different they are. A good way to do this is to use a Siamese network. Let’s take a look. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/4.png" alt=""><br>You’re used to seeing pictures of confidence like these where you input an image, let’s say x1. And through a sequence of convolutional and pulling and fully connected layers, end up with a feature vector like that. And sometimes this is fed to a softmax unit to make a classification. We’re not going to use that in this video. Instead, we’re going to focus on this vector of let’s say 128 numbers computed by some fully connected layer that is deeper in the network. And I’m going to give this list of 128 numbers a name. I’m going to <strong>call this f of x1, and you should think of f of x1 as an encoding of the input image x1</strong>. So it’s taken the input image, here this picture of Kian, and is re-representing it as a vector of 128 numbers. The way you can build a face recognition system is then that if you want to compare two pictures, let’s say this first picture with this second picture here. What you can do is feed this second picture to the same neural network with the same parameters and get a different vector of 128 numbers, which encodes this second picture. So I’m going to call this second picture. So I’m going to call this encoding of this second picture f of x2, and here I’m using x1 and x2 just to denote two input images. They don’t necessarily have to be the first and second examples in your training sets. It can be any two pictures. <strong>Finally, if you believe that these encodings are a good representation of these two images, what you can do is then define the image d of distance between x1 and x2 as the norm of the difference between the encodings of these two images. So this idea of running two identical, convolutional neural networks on two different inputs and then comparing them, sometimes that’s called a Siamese neural network architecture</strong>. And a lot of the ideas I’m presenting here came from this paper due to Yaniv Taigman, Ming Yang, Marc’Aurelio Ranzato, and Lior Wolf in the research system that they developed called DeepFace. And many of the ideas I’m presenting here came from a paper due to Yaniv Taigman, Ming Yang, Marc’Aurelio Ranzato, and Lior Wolf in a system that they developed called DeepFace. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/5.png" alt=""><br>So how do you train this Siamese neural network? Remember that these two neural networks have the same parameters. So what you want to do is really train the neural network so that the encoding that it computes results in a function d that tells you when two pictures are of the same person. So more formally, the parameters of the neural network define an encoding f of xi. So given any input image xi, the neural network outputs this 128 dimensional encoding f of xi. So more formally, what you want to do is learn parameters so that if two pictures, xi and xj, are of the same person, then you want that distance between their encodings to be small. And in the previous slide, l was using x1 and x2, but it’s really any pair xi and xj from your training set. And in contrast, if xi and xj are of different persons, then you want that distance between their encodings to be large. So as you vary the parameters in all of these layers of the neural network, you end up with different encodings. And what you can do is use back propagation and vary all those parameters in order to make sure these conditions are satisfied. </p>
<p>So you’ve learned about the Siamese network architecture and have a sense of what you want the neural network to output for you in terms of what would make a good encoding. But how do you actually define an objective function to make a neural network learn to do what we just discussed here? Let’s see how you can do that in the next video using the triplet loss function.</p>
<h3 id="04-triplet-loss"><a href="#04-triplet-loss" class="headerlink" title="04_triplet-loss"></a>04_triplet-loss</h3><p>One way to learn the parameters of the neural network so that it gives you a good encoding for your pictures of faces is to define an applied gradient descent on the triplet loss function. Let’s see what that means. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/6.png" alt=""><br>To apply the triplet loss, you need to compare pairs of images. For example, given this picture, to learn the parameters of the neural network, you have to look at several pictures at the same time. For example, given this pair of images, you want their encodings to be similar because these are the same person. Whereas, given this pair of images, you want their encodings to be quite different because these are different persons. In the terminology of the triplet loss, what you’re going do is always look at one anchor image and then you want to distance between the anchor and the positive image, really a positive example, meaning as the same person to be similar. Whereas, you want the anchor when pairs are compared to the negative example for their distances to be much further apart. <strong>So, this is what gives rise to the term triplet loss, which is that you’ll always be looking at three images at a time. You’ll be looking at an anchor image, a positive image, as well as a negative image. And I’m going to abbreviate anchor positive and negative as A, P, and N</strong>. So to formalize this, what you want is for the parameters of your neural network of your encodings to have the following property, which is that you want the encoding between the anchor minus the encoding of the positive example, you want this to be small and in particular, you want this to be less than or equal to the distance of the squared norm between the encoding of the anchor and the encoding of the negative, where of course, this is d of A, P and this is d of A, N. And you can think of d as a distance function, which is why we named it with the alphabet d. Now, if we move to term from the right side of this equation to the left side, what you end up with is f of A minus f of P squared minus, let’s take the right-hand side now, minus F of N squared, you want this to be less than or equal to zero. <strong>But now, we’re going to make a slight change to this expression, which is one trivial way to make sure this is satisfied, is to just learn everything equals zero. If f always equals zero, then this is zero minus zero, which is zero, this is zero minus zero which is zero. And so, well, by saying f of any image equals a vector of all zeroes, you can almost trivially satisfy this equation. So, to make sure that the neural network doesn’t just output zero for all the encoding, so to make sure that it doesn’t set all the encodings equal to each other. Another way for the neural network to give a trivial output is if the encoding for every image was identical to the encoding to every other image, in which case, you again get zero minus zero. So to prevent a neural network from doing that, what we’re going to do is modify this objective</strong> to say that, this doesn’t need to be just less than or equal to zero, it needs to be quite a bit smaller than zero. So, in particular, if we say this needs to be less than negative alpha, where alpha is another hyperparameter, then this prevents a neural network from outputting the trivial solutions. And by convention, usually, we write plus alpha instead of negative alpha there. And this is also called, <strong>a margin</strong>, which is terminology that you’d be familiar with if you’ve also seen the literature on support vector machines, but don’t worry about it if you haven’t. And we can also modify this equation on top by adding this margin parameter. So to give an example, let’s say the margin is set to 0.2. If in this example, d of the anchor and the positive is equal to 0.5, then you won’t be satisfied if d between the anchor and the negative was just a little bit bigger, say 0.51. Even though 0.51 is bigger than 0.5, you’re saying, that’s not good enough, we want a dfA, N to be much bigger than dfA, P and in particular, you want this to be at least 0.7 or higher. Alternatively, to achieve this margin or this gap of at least 0.2, you could either push this up or push this down so that there is at least this gap of this alpha, hyperparameter alpha 0.2 between the distance between the anchor and the positive versus the anchor and the negative. So that’s what having a margin parameter here does, which is it pushes the anchor positive pair and the anchor negative pair further away from each other. So, let’s take this equation we have here at the bottom, and on the next slide, formalize it, and define the triplet loss function. So, <strong>the triplet loss function is defined on triples of images</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/7.png" alt=""><br>So, given three images, A, P, and N, the anchor positive and negative examples. So the positive examples is of the same person as the anchor, but the negative is of a different person than the anchor. We’re going to define the loss as follows. The loss on this example, which is really defined on a triplet of images is, let me first copy over what we had on the previous slide. So, that was fA minus fP squared minus fA minus fN squared, and then plus alpha, the margin parameter. And what you want is for this to be less than or equal to zero. So, to define the loss function, let’s take the max between this and zero. So, the effect of taking the max here is that, so long as this is less than zero, then the loss is zero, because the max is something less than equal to zero, when zero is going to be zero. So, so long as you achieve the goal of making this thing I’ve underlined in green, so long as you’ve achieved the objective of making that less than or equal to zero, then the loss on this example is equals to zero. But if on the other hand, if this is greater than zero, then if you take the max, the max we end up selecting, this thing I’ve underlined in green, and so you would have a positive loss. So by trying to minimize this, this has the effect of trying to send this thing to be zero, less than or equal to zero. And then, so long as there’s zero or less than or equal to zero, the neural network doesn’t care how much further negative it is. So, this is how you define the loss on a single triplet and the overall cost function for your neural network can be sum over a training set of these individual losses on different triplets. So, if you have a training set of say 10,000 pictures with 1,000 different persons, what you’d have to do is take your 10,000 pictures and use it to generate, to select triplets like this and then train your learning algorithm using gradient descent on this type of cost function, which is really defined on triplets of images drawn from your training set. <strong>Notice that in order to define this dataset of triplets, you do need some pairs of A and P. Pairs of pictures of the same person. So the purpose of training your system, you do need a dataset where you have multiple pictures of the same person. That’s why in this example, I said if you have 10,000 pictures of 1,000 different person, so maybe have 10 pictures on average of each of your 1,000 persons to make up your entire dataset. If you had just one picture of each person, then you can’t actually train this system</strong>. But of course after training, if you’re applying this, but of course after having trained the system, you can then apply it to your one shot learning problem where for your face recognition system, maybe you have only a single picture of someone you might be trying to recognize. But for your training set, you do need to make sure you have multiple images of the same person at least for some people in your training set so that you can have pairs of anchor and positive images. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/8.png" alt=""><br>Now, how do you actually choose these triplets to form your training set? One of the problems if you choose A, P, and N randomly from your training set subject to A and P being from the same person, and A and N being different persons, one of the problems is that if you choose them so that they’re at random, then this constraint is very easy to satisfy. Because given two randomly chosen pictures of people, chances are A and N are much different than A and P. I hope you still recognize this notation, this d(A, P) was what we had written on the last few slides as this encoding. So this is just equal to this squared known distance between the encodings that we have on the previous slide. <strong>But if A and N are two randomly chosen different persons, then there is a very high chance that this will be much bigger more than the margin alpha that that term on the left. And so, the neural network won’t learn much from it. So to construct a training set, what you want to do is to choose triplets A, P, and N that are hard to train on. So in particular, what you want is for all triplets that this constraint be satisfied. So, a triplet that is hard will be if you choose values for A, P, and N so that maybe d(A, P) is actually quite close to d(A,N). So in that case, the learning algorithm has to try extra hard to take this thing on the right and try to push it up or take this thing on the left and try to push it down so that there is at least a margin of alpha between the left side and the right side. And the effect of choosing these triplets is that it increases the computational efficiency of your learning algorithm. If you choose your triplets randomly, then too many triplets would be really easy, and so, gradient descent won’t do anything because your neural network will just get them right, pretty much all the time. And it’s only by using hard triplets that the gradient descent procedure has to do some work to try to push these quantities further away from those quantities</strong>. And if you’re interested, the details are presented in this paper by Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalinichenko, and James Philbin, where they have a system called <strong>FaceNet</strong>, which is where a lot of the ideas I’m presenting in this video come from. </p>
<p>By the way, this is also a fun fact about how algorithms are often named in the deep learning world, which is if you work in a certain domain, then we call that blank. You often have a system called blank net or deep blank. So, we’ve been talking about face recognition. So this paper is called FaceNet, and in the last video, you just saw deep face. <strong>But this idea of a blank net or deep blank is a very popular way of naming algorithms in the deep learning world. And you should feel free to take a look at that paper if you want to learn some of these other details for speeding up your algorithm by choosing the most useful triplets to train on, it is a nice paper</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/9.png" alt=""><br>So, just to wrap up, to train on triplet loss, you need to take your training set and map it to a lot of triples. So, here is our triple with an anchor and a positive, both for the same person and the negative of a different person. Here’s another one where the anchor and positive are of the same person but the anchor and negative are of different persons and so on. And what you do having defined this training sets of anchor positive and negative triples is use gradient descent to try to minimize the cost function J we defined on an earlier slide, and that will have the effect of that propagating to all of the parameters of the neural network in order to learn an encoding so that d of two images will be small when these two images are of the same person, and they’ll be large when these are two images of different persons. </p>
<p>. <strong>Now, it turns out that today’s face recognition systems especially the large scale commercial face recognition systems are trained on very large datasets</strong>. Datasets north of a million images is not uncommon, some companies are using north of 10 million images and some companies have north of 100 million images with which to try to train these systems. So these are very large datasets even by modern standards, these dataset assets are not easy to acquire. <strong>Fortunately, some of these companies have trained these large networks and posted parameters online. So, rather than trying to train one of these networks from scratch, this is one domain where because of the share data volume sizes, this is one domain where often it might be useful for you to download someone else’s pre-train model, rather than do everything from scratch yourself. But even if you do download someone else’s pre-train model, I think it’s still useful to know how these algorithms were trained or in case you need to apply these ideas from scratch yourself for some application</strong>. So that’s it for the triplet loss. In the next video, I want to show you also some other variations on siamese networks and how to train these systems. Let’s go onto the next video.</p>
<h3 id="05-face-verification-and-binary-classification"><a href="#05-face-verification-and-binary-classification" class="headerlink" title="05_face-verification-and-binary-classification"></a>05_face-verification-and-binary-classification</h3><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/10.png" alt=""><br>The Triplet Loss is one good way to learn the parameters of a continent for face recognition. There’s another way to learn these parameters. Let me show you how face recognition can also be posed as a straight binary classification problem. Another way to train a neural network, is to take this pair of neural networks to take this Siamese Network and have them both compute these embeddings, maybe 128 dimensional embeddings, maybe even higher dimensional, and then have these be input to a logistic regression unit to then just make a prediction. Where the target output will be one if both of these are the same persons, and zero if both of these are of different persons. So, this is a way to treat face recognition just as a binary classification problem. And this is an alternative to the triplet loss for training a system like this. Now, what does this final logistic regression unit actually do? The output y hat will be a sigmoid function, applied to some set of features but rather than just feeding in, these encodings, what you can do is take the differences between the encodings. So, let me show you what I mean. Let’s say, I write a sum over K equals 1 to 128 of the absolute value, taken element wise between the two different encodings. Let me just finish writing this out and then we’ll see what this means. In this notation, f of x i is the encoding of the image $x_i$ and the substitute k means to just select out the kth components of this vector. <strong>This is taking the element Y’s difference in absolute values between these two encodings. And what you might do is think of these 128 numbers as features that you then feed into logistic regression. And, you’ll find that logistic regression can add additional parameters $w_i$, and $b$ similar to a normal logistic regression unit. And you would train appropriate weighting on these 128 features in order to predict whether or not these two images are of the same person or of different persons. So, this will be one pretty useful way to learn to predict zero or one whether these are the same person or different persons.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/11.png" alt=""><br>And there are a few other variations on how you can compute this formula that I had underlined in green. For example, another formula could be this k minus f of $x_j$, k squared divided by f of x i on plus f of x j k. This is sometimes called the chi square form. This is the Greek alphabet chi. But this is sometimes called a <strong>$\chi$ square similarity</strong>. And this and other variations are explored in this deep face paper, which I referenced earlier as well. So in this learning formulation, the input is a pair of images, so this is really your training input x and the output y is either zero or one depending on whether you’re inputting a pair of similar or dissimilar images. And same as before, you’re training is Siamese Network so that means that, this neural network up here has parameters that are what they’re really tied to the parameters in this lower neural network. And this system can work pretty well as well. <strong>Lastly, just to mention, one computational trick that can help neural deployment significantly, which is that, if this is the new image, so this is an employee walking in hoping that the turnstile the doorway will open for them and that this is from your database image. Then instead of having to compute, this embedding every single time, where you can do is actually pre-compute that, so, when the new employee walks in, what you can do is use this upper components to compute that encoding and use it, then compare it to your pre-computed encoding and then use that to make a prediction y hat. Because you don’t need to store the raw images and also because if you have a very large database of employees, you don’t need to compute these encodings every single time for every employee database. This idea of free computing, some of these encodings can save a significant computation</strong>. And this type of pre-computation works both for this type of Siamese Central architecture where you treat face recognition as a binary classification problem, as well as, when you were learning encodings maybe using the Triplet Loss function as described in the last couple of videos. </p>
<p>And so just to wrap up, to treat face verification supervised learning, you create a training set of just pairs of images now is of triplets of pairs of images where the target label is one. When these are a pair of pictures of the same person and where the tag label is zero, when these are pictures of different persons and you use different pairs to train the neural network to train the scientists that were using back propagation. </p>
<p>So, this version that you just saw of treating face verification and by extension face recognition as a binary classification problem, this works quite well as well. As sort of that, I hope that you now know, whether it would take to train your own face verification or your own face recognition system one that can do one.</p>

You get to implement this yourself and generate your own artwork in the problem exercise. But what is Neural Style Transfer? Let me show you a few examples. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/12.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say you take this image, this is actually taken from the Stanford University not far from my Stanford office and you want this picture recreated in the style of this image on the right. This is actually Van Gogh’s, Starry Night painting. What Neural Style Transfer allows you to do is generated new image like the one below which is a picture of the Stanford University Campus that painted but drawn in the style of the image on the right. In order to describe how you can implement this yourself, I’m going to use C to denote the content image, S to denote the style image, and G to denote the image you will generate. Here’s another example, let’s say you have this content image so let’s see this is of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and you have this style image, this is actually Pablo Picasso image. You can then combine these to generate this image G which is the Golden Gate painted in the style of that Picasso shown on the right. The examples shown on this slide were generated by Justin Johnson. </p>
<p>What you’ll learn in the next few videos is how you can generate these images yourself. In order to implement Neural Style Transfer, you need to look at the features extracted by ConvNet at various layers, the shallow and the deeper layers of a ConvNet. Before diving into how you can implement a Neural Style Transfer, what I want to do in the next video is try to give you better intuition about whether all these layers of a ConvNet really computing. Let’s take a look at that in the next video.</p>
<h3 id="02-what-are-deep-convnets-learning"><a href="#02-what-are-deep-convnets-learning" class="headerlink" title="02_what-are-deep-convnets-learning"></a>02_what-are-deep-convnets-learning</h3><p>What are deep ConvNets really learning? In this video, I want to share with you some visualizations that will help you hone your intuition about what the deeper layers of a ConvNet really are doing. And this will help us think through how you can implement neural style transfer as well. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/13.png" alt=""><br>Let’s start with an example. Lets say you’ve trained a ConvNet, this is an alex net like network, and you want to visualize what the hidden units in different layers are computing. Here’s what you can do. Let’s start with a hidden unit in layer 1. And suppose you scan through your training sets and find out what are the images or what are the image patches that maximize that unit’s activation. <strong>So in other words pause your training set through your neural network, and figure out what is the image that maximizes that particular unit’s activation. Now, notice that a hidden unit in layer 1, will see only a relatively small portion of the neural network</strong>. And so if you visualize, if you plot what activated unit’s activation, it makes makes sense to plot just a small image patches, because all of the image that that particular unit sees. <strong>So if you pick one hidden unit and find the nine input images that maximizes that unit’s activation, you might find nine image patches like this</strong>.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/15.png" alt=""><br>So looks like that in the lower region of an image that this particular hidden unit sees, <strong>it’s looking for an egde or a line that looks like that</strong>. So those are the nine image patches that maximally activate one hidden unit’s activation. Now, you can then pick a different hidden unit in layer 1 and do the same thing.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/16.png" alt=""><br>So that’s a different hidden unit, and looks like this second one, represented by these 9 image patches here. Looks like <strong>this hidden unit is looking for a line sort of in that portion of its input region</strong>, we’ll also call this <strong>receptive field</strong>. And if you do this for other hidden units, you’ll find other hidden units, tend to activate in image patches that look like that.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/17.png" alt=""><br>This one seems to have <strong>a preference for a vertical light edge</strong>, but with a preference that the left side of it be green.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/18.png" alt=""><br>This one really <strong>prefers orange colors</strong>, and this is an interesting image patch. This red and green together will make a brownish or a brownish-orangish color, but the neuron is still happy to activate with that, and so on.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/19.png" alt=""><br>So this is nine different representative neurons and for each of them the nine image patches that they maximally activate on. <strong>So this gives you a sense that, units, train hidden units in layer 1, they’re often looking for relatively simple features such as edge or a particular shade of color. And all of the examples I’m using in this video come from this paper by Mathew Zeiler and Rob Fergus, titled visualizing and understanding convolutional networks. And I’m just going to use one of the simpler ways to visualize what a hidden unit in a neural network is computing. If you read their paper, they have some other more sophisticated ways of visualizing when the ConvNet is running as well</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/20.png" alt=""><br>But now you have repeated this procedure several times for nine hidden units in layer 1. What if you do this for some of the hidden units in the deeper layers of the neuron network. And what does the neural network then learning at a deeper layers. So in the deeper layers, a hidden unit will see a larger region of the image. Where at the extreme end each pixel could hypothetically affect the output of these later layers of the neural network. So later units are actually seen larger image patches, I’m still going to plot the image patches as the same size on these slides. But if we repeat this procedure, this is what you had previously for layer 1, and this is a visualization of what maximally activates nine different hidden units in layer 2. So I want to be clear about what this visualization is. These are the nine patches that cause one hidden unit to be highly activated. And then each grouping, this is a different set of nine image patches that cause one hidden unit to be activated. So this visualization shows nine hidden units in layer 2, and for each of them shows nine image patches that causes that hidden unit to have a very large output, a very large activation. And you can repeat these for deeper layers as well. </p>
<p>Now, on this slide, I know it’s kind of hard to see these tiny little image patches, so let me zoom in for some of them. For layer 1, this is what you saw. <img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/21.png" alt=""> So for example, this is that first unit we saw which was highly activated, <strong>if in the region of the input image, you can see there’s an edge maybe at that angle</strong>. </p>
<p>Now let’s zoom in for layer 2 as well, to that visualization.<img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/22.png" alt=""> So this is interesting, layer 2 looks it’s detecting <strong>more complex shapes and patterns</strong>. So for example, this hidden unit looks like it’s looking for a vertical texture with lots of vertical lines. This hidden unit looks like its highly activated when there’s a rounder shape to the left part of the image. Here’s one that is looking for very thin vertical lines and so on. And so the features the second layer is detecting are getting more complicated. </p>
<p>How about layer 3? Let’s zoom into that, in fact let me zoom in even bigger, so you can see this better, these are the things that maximally activate layer 3.<img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/23.png" alt=""> But let’s zoom in even bigger, and so this is pretty interesting again. It looks like there is a hidden unit that seems to respond highly to a rounder shape in the lower left hand portion of the image, maybe. So that ends up detecting a lot of cars, dogs and wonders is even starting to detect people. And this one look like it is detecting certain textures like honeycomb shapes, or square shapes, this irregular texture. And some of these it’s difficult to look at and manually figure out what is it detecting, but it is clearly starting to detect more complex patterns. </p>
<p>How about the next layer? Well, here is layer 4, and you’ll see that the features or the patterns is detecting or even more complex. <img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/24.png" alt=""> It looks like this has learned almost a dog detector, but all these dogs likewise similar, right? Is this, I don’t know what dog species or dog breed this is. But now all those are dogs, but they look relatively similar as dogs go. Looks like this hidden unit and therefore it is detecting water. This looks like it is actually detecting the legs of a bird and so on. </p>
<p>And then layer 5 is detecting even more sophisticated things. <img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/25.png" alt=""> So you’ll notice there’s also a neuron that seems to be a dog detector, but set of dogs detecting here seems to be more varied. And then this seems to be detecting keyboards and things with a keyboard like texture, although maybe lots of dots against background. I think this neuron here may be detecting text, it’s always hard to be sure. And then this one here is detecting flowers. So we’ve gone a long way from detecting relatively simple things such as edges in layer 1 to textures in layer 2, up to detecting very complex objects in the deeper layers. </p>
<p>So I hope this gives you some better intuition about what the shallow and deeper layers of a neural network are computing. Next, let’s use this intuition to start building a neural-style transfer algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="03-cost-function"><a href="#03-cost-function" class="headerlink" title="03_cost-function"></a>03_cost-function</h3><p>To build a Neural Style Transfer system, let’s define a cost function for the generated image. What you see later is that by minimizing this cost function, you can generate the image that you want. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/26.png" alt=""><br>Remember what the problem formulation is. You’re given a content image C, given a style image S and you goal is to generate a new image G. In order to implement neural style transfer, what you’re going to do is define a cost function J of G that measures how good is a particular generated image and we’ll use gradient to descent to minimize J of G in order to generate this image. How good is a particular image? Well, we’re going to define two parts to this cost function. The first part is called the <strong>content cost</strong>. This is a function of the content image and of the generated image and what it does is it measures how similar is the contents of the generated image to the content of the content image C. And then going to add that to a <strong>style cost function</strong> which is now a function of S,G and what this does is it measures how similar is the style of the image G to the style of the image S. Finally, we’ll weight these with two hyper parameters alpha and beta to specify the relative weighting between the content costs and the style cost. <strong>It seems redundant to use two different hyper parameters to specify the relative cost of the weighting. One hyper parameter seems like it would be enough but the original authors of the Neural Style Transfer Algorithm, use two different hyper parameters. I’m just going to follow their convention here</strong>. </p>
<p>The Neural Style Transfer Algorithm I’m going to present in the next few videos is due to Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker and Matthias. Their papers is not too hard to read so after watching these few videos if you wish, I certainly encourage you to take a look at their paper as well if you want. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/27.png" alt=""><br>The way the algorithm would run is as follows, having to find the cost function J of G in order to actually generate a new image what you do is the following. <strong>You would initialize the generated image G randomly so it might be 100 by 100 by 3 or 500 by 500 by 3 or whatever dimension you want it to be. Then we’ll define the cost function J of G on the previous slide. What you can do is use gradient descent to minimize this so you can update G as G minus the derivative respect to the cost function of J of G. In this process, you’re actually updating the pixel values of this image G which is a 100 by 100 by 3 maybe rgb channel image</strong>. Here’s an example, let’s say you start with this content image and this style image. This is a another probably Picasso image. Then when you initialize G randomly, you’re initial randomly generated image is just this white noise image with each pixel value chosen at random. As you run gradient descent, you minimize the cost function J of G slowly through the pixel value so then you get slowly an image that looks more and more like your content image rendered in the style of your style image. </p>
<p>In this video, you saw the overall outline of the Neural Style Transfer Algorithm where you define a cost function for the generated image G and minimize it. Next, we need to see how to define the content cost function as well as the style cost function. Let’s take a look at that starting in the next video.</p>
<h3 id="04-content-cost-function"><a href="#04-content-cost-function" class="headerlink" title="04_content-cost-function"></a>04_content-cost-function</h3><p>The cost function of the neural style transfer algorithm had a content cost component and a style cost component. Let’s start by defining the content cost component. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/28.png" alt=""><br>Remember that this is the overall cost function of the neural style transfer algorithm. So, let’s figure out what should the content cost function be. <strong>Let’s say that you use hidden layer l to compute the content cost. If l is a very small number, if you use hidden layer one, then it will really force your generated image to pixel values very similar to your content image. Whereas, if you use a very deep layer, then it’s just asking, “Well, if there is a dog in your content image, then make sure there is a dog somewhere in your generated image. “ So in practice, layer l chosen somewhere in between. It’s neither too shallow nor too deep in the neural network.</strong> And because you program this yourself, in the problem exercise that you did at the end of this week, I’ll leave you to gain some intuitions with the concrete examples in the problem exercise as well. But usually, I was chosen to be somewhere in the middle of the layers of the neural network, neither too shallow nor too deep. What you can do is then use a pre-trained ConvNet, maybe a VGG network, or could be some other neural network as well. And now, you want to measure, given a content image and given a generated image, how similar are they in content. So let’s let this a_superscript_<a href="c">l</a> and this be the activations of layer l on these two images, on the images C and G. So, if these two activations are similar, then that would seem to imply that both images have similar content. So, what we’ll do is define J_content(C,G) as just how soon or how different are these two activations. So, we’ll take the element-wise difference between these hidden unit activations in layer l, between when you pass in the content image compared to when you pass in the generated image, and take that squared. And you could have a normalization constant in front or not, so it’s just one of the two or something else. It doesn’t really matter since this can be adjusted as well by this hyperparameter alpha. So, just be clear on using this notation as if both of these have been unrolled into vectors, so then, this becomes the square root of the l_2 norm between this and this, after you’ve unrolled them both into vectors. There’s really just the element-wise sum of squared differences between these two activation. But <strong>it’s really just the element-wise sum of squares of differences between the activations in layer l, between the images in C and G</strong>. And so, <strong>when later you perform gradient descent on J_of_G to try to find a value of G, so that the overall cost is low, this will incentivize the algorithm to find an image G, so that these hidden layer activations are similar to what you got for the content image</strong>. </p>
<p>So, that’s how you define the content cost function for the neural style transfer. Next, let’s move on to the style cost function.</p>
<h3 id="05-style-cost-function"><a href="#05-style-cost-function" class="headerlink" title="05_style-cost-function"></a>05_style-cost-function</h3><p>In the last video, you saw how to define the content cost function for the neural style transfer. Next, let’s take a look at the style cost function. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/29.png" alt=""><br>So, what is the style of an image mean? Let’s say you have an input image like this, they used to seeing a convnet like that, compute features that there’s different layers. And let’s say you’ve chosen some layer L, maybe that layer to define the measure of the style of an image. What we need to do is define the style as the correlation between activations across different channels in this layer L activation. So here’s what I mean by that. Let’s say you take that layer L activation. So this is going to be nh by nw by nc block of activations, and we’re going to ask how correlated are the activations across different channels. So to explain what I mean by this may be slightly cryptic phrase, let’s take this block of activations and let me shade the different channels by a different colors. So in this below example, we have say five channels and which is why I have five shades of color here. In practice, of course, in neural network we usually have a lot more channels than five, but using just five makes it drawing easier. But to capture the style of an image, what you’re going to do is the following. <strong>Let’s look at the first two channels. Let’s see for the red channel and the yellow channel and say how correlated are activations in these first two channels. So, for example, in the lower right hand corner, you have some activation in the first channel and some activation in the second channel. So that gives you a pair of numbers. And what you do is look at different positions across this block of activations and just look at those two pairs of numbers, one in the first channel, the red channel, one in the yellow channel, the second channel. And you just look at these two pairs of numbers and see when you look across all of these positions, all of these nh by nw positions, how correlated are these two numbers. So, why does this capture style</strong>? </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/30.png" alt=""><br>Let’s look another example. Here’s one of the visualizations from the earlier video. This comes from again the paper by Matthew Zeiler and Rob Fergus that I have reference earlier. <strong>And let’s say for the sake of arguments, that the red neuron corresponds to, and let’s say for the sake of arguments, that the red channel corresponds to this neurons (at the second grid cell which is circled in red color), so we’re trying to figure out if there’s this little vertical texture in a particular position in the nh and let’s say that this second channel, this yellow second channel corresponds to this neuron (at the 4th grid cell which is circled in yellow color), which is vaguely looking for orange colored patches. What does it mean for these two channels to be highly correlated? Well, if they’re highly correlated what that means is whatever part of the image has this type of subtle vertical texture, that part of the image will probably have these orange-ish tint. And what does it mean for them to be uncorrelated? Well, it means that whenever there is this vertical texture, it’s probably won’t have that orange-ish tint. And so the correlation tells you which of these high level texture components tend to occur or not occur together in part of an image and that’s the degree of correlation that gives you one way of measuring how often these different high level features, such as vertical texture or this orange tint or other things as well, how often they occur and how often they occur together and don’t occur together in different parts of an image. And so, if we use the degree of correlation between channels as a measure of the style, then what you can do is measure the degree to which in your generated image, this first channel is correlated or uncorrelated with the second channel and that will tell you in the generated image how often this type of vertical texture occurs or doesn’t occur with this orange-ish tint and this gives you a measure of how similar is the style of the generated image to the style of the input style image</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/31.png" alt=""><br>So let’s now formalize this intuition. So what you can to do is given an image computes something called <strong>a style matrix</strong>, which will measure all those correlations we talks about on the last slide. So, more formally, let’s let a superscript l, subscript i, j,k denote the activation at position i,j,k in hidden layer l. So i indexes into the height, j indexes into the width, and k indexes across the different channels. So, in the previous slide, we had five channels that k will index across those five channels. So what the style matrix will do is you’re going to compute a matrix clauses G superscript square bracketed l. This is going to be an nc by nc dimensional matrix, so it’d be a square matrix. Remember you have nc channels and so you have an nc by nc dimensional matrix in order to measure how correlated each pair of them is. <strong>So particular G, l, k, k prime will measure how correlated are the activations in channel k compared to the activations in channel k prime. Well here, k and k prime will range from 1 through nc, the number of channels they’re all up in that layer.</strong> So more formally, the way you compute G, l and I’m just going to write down the formula for computing one elements. So the k, k prime elements of this. This is going to be sum of a i, sum of a j, of deactivation and that layer i, j, k times the activation at i, j, k prime. So, here, remember i and j index across to a different positions in the block, indexes over the height and width. So i is the sum from one to nh and j is a sum from one to nw and k here and k prime index over the channel so k and k prime range from one to the total number of channels in that layer of the neural network. <strong>So all this is doing is summing over the different positions that the image over the height and width and just multiplying the activations together of the channels k and k prime and that’s the definition of G,k,k prime. And you do this for every value of k and k prime to compute this matrix G, also called the style matrix.</strong> And so notice that if both of these activations tend to be large together, then G, k, k prime will be large, whereas if they are uncorrelated then g,k, k prime might be small. And technically, I’ve been using the term correlation to convey intuition but this is actually the <strong>unnormalized cross-variance</strong> of the areas because we’re not subtracting out the mean and this is just multiplied by these elements directly. So this is how you compute the style of an image. And you’d actually do this for both the style image s,n for the generated image G. So just to distinguish that this is the style image, maybe let me add a round bracket S there, just to denote that this is the style image for the image S and those are the activations on the image S. And what you do is then compute the same thing for the generated image. So it’s really the same thing summarized sum of a j, a, i, j, k, l, a, i, j,k,l and the summation indices are the same. Let’s follow this and you want to just denote this is for the generated image, I’ll just put the round brackets G there. So, now, you have two matrices they capture what is the style with the image s and what is the style of the image G. And, by the way, we’ve been using the alphabet capital G to denote these matrices. In linear algebra, these are also called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramian_matrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gram matrix</a> of these in called grand matrices but <strong>in this video, I’m just going to use the term style matrix because this term Gram matrix that most of these using capital G to denote these matrices</strong>. Finally, the cost function, the style cost function. If you’re doing this on layer l between s and G, you can now define that to be just the difference between these two matrices, G l, G square and these are matrices. So just take it from the previous one. This is just the sum of squares of the element wise differences between these two matrices and just divides this out this is going to be sum over k, sum over k prime of these differences of s, k, k prime minus G l, G, k, k prime and then the sum of square of the elements. The authors actually used this for the normalization constants two times of nh, nw, in that layer, nc in that layer and I’ll square this and you can put this up here as well. But a normalization constant doesn’t matter that much because this causes multiplied by some hyperparameter b anyway. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/32.png" alt=""><br>So just to finish up, this is the style cost function defined using layer l and as you saw on the previous slide, this is basically the Frobenius norm between the two star matrices computed on the image s and on the image G Frobenius on squared and never by the just low normalization constants, which isn’t that important. <strong>And, finally, it turns out that you get more visually pleasing results if you use the style cost function from multiple different layers. So, the overall style cost function, you can define as sum over all the different layers of the style cost function for that layer. We should define them all weighted by some set of parameters, by some set of additional hyperparameters, which we’ll denote as lambda l here. So what it does is allows you to use different layers in a neural network. Well of the early ones, which measure relatively simpler low level features like edges as well as some later layers, which measure high level features and cause a neural network to take both low level and high level correlations into account when computing style.</strong> And, in the following exercise, you gain more intuition about what might be reasonable choices for this type of parameter lambda as well. And so just to wrap this up, you can now define the overall cost function as alpha times the content cost between c and G plus beta times the style cost between s and G and then just create in the sense or a more sophisticated optimization algorithm if you want in order to try to find an image G that normalize, that tries to minimize this cost function j of G. And if you do that, you can generate pretty good looking neural artistic and if you do that you’ll be able to generate some pretty nice novel artwork. </p>
<p>So that’s it for neural style transfer and I hope you have fun implementing it in this week’s printing exercise. <strong>Before wrapping up this week, there’s just one last thing I want to share of you, which is how to do convolutions over 1D or 3D data rather than over only 2D images</strong>. Let’s go into the last video.</p>
<h3 id="06-1d-and-3d-generalizations"><a href="#06-1d-and-3d-generalizations" class="headerlink" title="06_1d-and-3d-generalizations"></a>06_1d-and-3d-generalizations</h3><p>You have learned a lot about ConvNets, everything ranging from the architecture of the ConvNet to how to use it for image recognition, to object detection, to face recognition and neural-style transfer. And even though most of the discussion has focused on images, on sort of 2D data, because images are so pervasive. It turns out that many of the ideas you’ve learned about also apply, not just to 2D images but also to 1D data as well as to 3D data. Let’s take a look. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week4/images/33.png" alt=""><br>In the first week of this course, you learned about the 2D convolution, where you might input a 14 x 14 image and convolve that with a 5 x 5 filter. And you saw how 14 x 14 convolved with 5 x 5, this gives you a 10 x 10 output. And if you have multiple channels, maybe those 14 x 14 x 3, then it would be 5 x 5 that matches the same 3. And then if you have multiple filters, say 16 filters, you end up with 10 x 10 x 16. It turns out that a similar idea can be applied to 1D data as well. For example, on the left is <strong>an EKG signa</strong>l, also called <strong>an electrocardioagram</strong>. Basically if you place an electrode over your chest, this measures the little voltages that vary across your chest as your heart beats. Because the little electric waves generated by your heart’s beating can be measured with a pair of electrodes. And so this is an EKG of someone’s heart beating. And so <strong>each of these peaks corresponds to one heartbeat. So if you want to use EKG signals to make medical diagnoses, for example, then you would have 1D data because what EKG data is, is it’s a time series showing the voltage at each instant in time</strong>. So rather than a 14 x 14 dimensional input, <strong>maybe you just have a 14 dimensional input. And in that case, you might want to convolve this with a 1 dimensional filter</strong>. So rather than the 5 by 5, <strong>you just have 5 dimensional filter</strong>. So with 2D data what a convolution will allow you to do was to take the same 5 x 5 feature detector and apply it across at different positions throughout the image. And that’s how you wound up with your 10 x 10 output. What a 1D filter allows you to do is take your 5 dimensional filter and similarly apply that in lots of different positions throughout this 1D signal. And so <strong>if you apply this convolution, what you find is that a 14 dimensional thing convolved with this 5 dimensional thing, this would give you a 10 dimensional output. And again, if you have multiple channels, you might have in this case you can use just 1 channel, if you have 1 lead or 1 electrode for EKG, so times 5 x 1. And if you have 16 filters, maybe end up with 10 x 16 over there, and this could be one layer of your ConvNet. And then for the next layer of your ConvNet, if you input a 10 x 16 dimensional input and you might convolve that with a 5 dimensional filter again. Then these have 16 channels, so that has a match. And we have 32 filters, then the output of another layer would be 6 x 32</strong>, if you have 32 filters, right? And the analogy to the the 2D data, this is similar to all of the 10 x 10 x 16 data and convolve it with a 5 x 5 x 16, and that has to match. That will give you a 6 by 6 dimensional output, and you have 32 filters, that’s where the 32 comes from. So all of these ideas apply also to 1D data, where you can have the same feature detector, such as this, apply to a variety of positions. For example, to detect the different heartbeats in an EKG signal. But to use the same set of features to detect the heartbeats even at different positions along these time series, and so ConvNet can be used even on 1D data. For along with 1D data applications, you actually use a recurrent neural network, which you learn about in the next course. But some people can also try using ConvNets in these problems. And in the next course on sequence models, which we will talk about recurring neural networks and LCM and other models like that. We’ll talk about the pros and cons of using 1D ConvNets versus some of those other models that are explicitly designed to sequenced data. So that’s the generalization from 2D to 1D. </p>
<p><img src="I://imgs/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/04_special-applications-face-recognition-neural-style-transfer/2.gif" alt=""><br>How about 3D data? Well, what is three dimensional data? It is that, instead of having a 1D list of numbers or a 2D matrix of numbers, you now have a 3D block, a three dimensional input volume of numbers. So here’s the example of that which is if you take a <strong>CT scan</strong>, this is a type of <strong>X-ray scan</strong> that gives a three dimensional model of your body. But what a CT scan does is it takes different slices through your body. So as you scan through a CT scan which I’m doing here, you can look at different slices of the human torso to see how they look and so this data is fundamentally three dimensional. And one way to think of this data is if your data now has some height, some width, and then also some depth. Where this is the different slices through this volume, are the different slices through the torso. </p>
<p>So if you want to apply a ConvNet to detect features in this three dimensional CAT scan or CT scan, then you can generalize the ideas from the first slide to three dimensional convolutions as well. So if you have a 3D volume, and for the sake of simplicity let’s say is 14 x 14 x 14 and so this is the height, width, and depth of the input CT scan. And again, just like images they’ll all have to be square, a 3D volume doesn’t have to be a perfect cube as well. So the height and width of a image can be different, and in the same way the height and width and the depth of a CT scan can be different. But I’m just using 14 x 14 x 14 here to simplify the discussion. And if you convolve this with a now a 5 x 5 x 5 filter, so you’re filters now are also three dimensional then this would give you a 10 x 10 x 10 volume. And technically, you could also have by 1, if this is the number of channels. So this is just a 3D volume, but your data can also have different numbers of channels, then this would be times 1 as well. Because the number of channels here and the number of channels here has to match. And then if you have 16 filters did a 5 x 5 x 5 x 1 then the next output will be a 10 x 10 x 10 x 16. So this could be one layer of your ConvNet over 3D data, and if the next layer of the ConvNet convolves this again with a 5 x 5 x 5 x 16 dimensional filter. So this number of channels has to match data as usual, and if you have 32 filters then similar to what you saw was ConvNet of the images. Now you’ll end up with a 6 x 6 x 6 volume across 32 channels. So 3D data can also be learned on, sort of directly using a three dimensional ConvNet. And what these filters do is really detect features across your 3D data, CAT scans, medical scans as one example of 3D volumes. But another example of data, you could treat as a 3D volume would be movie data, where the different slices could be different slices in time through a movie. And you could use this to detect motion or people taking actions in movies. </p>
<p>So that’s it on generalization of ConvNets from 2D data to also 1D as well as 3D data. Image data is so pervasive that the vast majority of ConvNets are on 2D data, on image data, but I hope that these other models will be helpful to you as well. So this is it, this is the last video of this week and the last video of this course on ConvNets. You’ve learned a lot about ConvNets and I hope you find many of these ideas useful for your future work. So congratulations on finishing these videos. I hope you enjoyed this week’s exercise and I look forward also to seeing you in the next course on sequence models.</p>
