          <h2 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h2><p>This is my personal note after studying the course of the 1st week <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convolutional neural networks</a> and the copyright belongs to <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeplearning.ai</a>.</p>
<h2 id="01-computer-vision"><a href="#01-computer-vision" class="headerlink" title="01_computer-vision"></a>01_computer-vision</h2><p>Welcome to this course on Convolutional Networks. Computer vision is one of the areas that’s been advancing rapidly thanks to deep learning. Deep learning computer vision is now helping self-driving cars figure out where the other cars and pedestrians around so as to avoid them. Is making face recognition work much better than ever before, so that perhaps some of you will soon, or perhaps already, be able to unlock a phone, unlock even a door using just your face. And if you look on your cell phone, I bet you have many apps that show you pictures of food, or pictures of a hotel, or just fun pictures of scenery. And some of the companies that build those apps are using deep learning to help show you the most attractive, the most beautiful, or the most relevant pictures. And I think deep learning is even enabling new types of art to be created. So, I think the two reasons I’m excited about deep learning for computer vision and why I think you might be too. First, rapid advances in computer vision are enabling brand new applications to view, though they just were impossible a few years ago. And by learning these tools, perhaps you will be able to invent some of these new products and applications. Second, even if you don’t end up building computer vision systems per se, I found that because the computer vision research community has been so creative and so inventive in coming up with new neural network architectures and algorithms, is actually inspire that creates a lot cross-fertilization into other areas as well. For example, when I was working on speech recognition, I sometimes actually took inspiration from ideas from computer vision and borrowed them into the speech literature. So, even if you don’t end up working on computer vision, I hope that you find some of the ideas you learn about in this course hopeful for some of your algorithms and your architectures. So with that, let’s get started.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/1.png" alt=""><br>Here are some examples of computer vision problems we’ll study in this course. You’ve already seen image classifications, sometimes also called image recognition, where you might take as input say a 64 by 64 image and try to figure out, is that a cat? Another example of the computer vision problem is object detection. So, if you’re building a self-driving car, maybe you don’t just need to figure out that there are other cars in this image. But instead, you need to figure out the position of the other cars in this picture, so that your car can avoid them. In object detection, usually, we have to not just figure out that these other objects say cars and picture, but also draw boxes around them. We have some other way of recognizing where in the picture are these objects. And notice also, in this example, that they can be multiple cars in the same picture, or at least every one of them within a certain distance of your car. Here’s another example, maybe a more fun one is neural style transfer. Let’s say you have a picture, and you want this picture repainted in a different style. So neural style transfer, you have a content image, and you have a style image. The image on the right is actually a Picasso. And you can have a neural network put them together to repaint the content image (that is the image on the left), but in the style of the image on the right, and you end up with the image at the bottom. So, algorithms like these are enabling new types of artwork to be created. And in this course, you’ll learn how to do this yourself as well. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/2.png" alt=""><br>One of the challenges of computer vision problems is that the inputs can get really big. For example, in previous courses, you’ve worked with 64 by 64 images. And so that’s 64 by 64 by 3 because there are three color channels. And if you multiply that out, that’s 12288. So x the input features has dimension 12288. And that’s not too bad. But 64 by 64 is actually a very small image. If you work with larger images, maybe this is a 1000 pixel by 1000 pixel image, and that’s actually just one megapixel. But the dimension of the input features will be 1000 by 1000 by 3, because you have three RGB channels, and that’s three million. If you are viewing this on a smaller screen, this might not be apparent, but this is actually a low res 64 by 64 image, and this is a higher res 1000 by 1000 image. But if you have three million input features, then this means that X here will be three million dimensional. And so, if in the first hidden layer maybe you have just a 1000 hidden units, then the total number of weights that is the matrix W1, if you use a standard or fully connected network like we have in courses one or two. This matrix will be a 1000 by 3 million dimensional matrix. Because X is now R by three million. 3m. I’m using to denote three million. <strong>And this means that this matrix here will have three billion parameters which is just very, very large. And with that many parameters, it’s difficult to get enough data to prevent a neural network from overfitting. And also, the computational requirements and the memory requirements to train a neural network with three billion parameters is just a bit infeasible</strong>. </p>
<p>But for computer vision applications, you don’t want to be stuck using only tiny little images. <strong>You want to use large images. To do that, you need to better implement the convolution operation, which is one of the fundamental building blocks of convolutional neural networks</strong>. Let’s see what this means, and how you can implement this, in the next video. And we’ll illustrate convolutions, using the example of-</p>
<h2 id="02-edge-detection-example"><a href="#02-edge-detection-example" class="headerlink" title="02_edge-detection-example"></a>02_edge-detection-example</h2><p>The convolution operation is one of the fundamental building blocks of a convolutional neural network. Using <strong>edge detection</strong> as the motivating example in this video, you will see how the convolution operation works. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/3.png" alt=""><br>In previous videos, I have talked about how <strong>the early layers of the neural network might detect edges and then the some later layers might detect cause of objects and then even later layers may detect cause of complete objects like people’s faces in this case</strong>. In this video, you see how you can detect edges in an image. Lets take an example. Given a picture like that for a computer to <strong>figure out what are the objects</strong> in this picture, <strong>the first thing you might do is maybe detect vertical edges</strong> in this image. For example, this image has all those vertical lines, where the buildings are, as well as kind of vertical lines idea all lines of these pedestrians and so those get detected in this vertical edge detector output. And <strong>you might also want to detect horizontal edges</strong> so for example, there is a very strong horizontal line where this railing is and that also gets detected sort of roughly here. How do you detect edges in image like this?</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/11.png" alt=""><br>Let us look with an example. Here is a 6 by 6 grayscale image and because this is a grayscale image, this is just a 6 by 6 by 1 matrix rather than 6 by 6 by 3 because they are on a separate rgb channels. In order to detect edges or lets say vertical edges in his image, what you can do is construct a 3 by 3 matrix and in the pooling when the terminology of convolutional neural networks, this is going to be called a filter. And I am going to construct a 3 by 3 filter or 3 by 3 matrix that looks like this 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1. Sometimes research papers will call this a <strong>kernel</strong> instead of a <strong>filter</strong> but I am going to use the filter terminology in these videos. And what you are going to do is take the 6 by 6 image and convolve it and the convolution operation is denoted by this asterisk and convolve it with the 3 by 3 filter. <strong>One slightly unfortunate thing about the notation is that in mathematics, the asterisk is the standard symbol for convolution but in Python, this is also used to denote multiplication or maybe element-wise multiplication</strong>. This asterisk has dual purposes is overloaded notation but I will try to be clear in these videos when this asterisk refers to convolution. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/5.png" alt=""><br>The output of this convolution operator will be a 4 by 4 matrix, which you can interpret, which you can think of as a 4 by 4 image. The way you compute this 4 by 4 output is as follows, to compute the first elements, the upper left element of this 4 by 4 matrix, what you are going to do is take the 3 by 3 filter and paste it on top of the 3 by 3 region of your original input image. I have written here 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1. And what you should do is take the element-wise product so the first one would be three times 1 and then the second one would be one times one I’m going down here, one times one and then plus two times one, just one and then add up all of the resulting nine numbers. So then the middle column gives you zero times zero, plus five times zero, plus seven times zero and then the right most column gives one times -1, eight times -1, plus two times -1. Adding up these nine numbers will give you <strong>negative 5</strong> and so I’m going to fill in negative 5 over here. You can add up these nine numbers in any order of course. It is just that I went down the first column, then second column, then the third. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/6.png" alt=""><br><strong>Next</strong>, to figure out what is this second element, you are going to <strong>take the blue square and shift it one step to the right like so</strong>. Let me get rid of the green marks here. <strong>You are going to do the same element wise product and then addition</strong>. You have zero times one, plus five times one, plus seven times one, plus one time zero, plus eight times zero, plus two times zero, plus two times negative 1, plus nine times negative one, plus five times negative one and if you add up those nine numbers, you end up with <strong>negative four</strong> and so on.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/7.png" alt=""><br>If you shift this to the right, do the nine products and add them up, you get <strong>zero</strong> and then over here you should get 8.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/8.png" alt=""><br>Just to verify, you have 2 plus 9 plus 5 that’s 16. Then the middle column gives you zero and then the right most column 4 plus 1 plus three times negative 1, that’s -8 so that is 16 on the left column -8 and that gives you <strong>8</strong> like we have over here. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/9.png" alt=""><br><strong>Next, in order to get you this element in the next row what you do is take the blue square and now shift it one down</strong> so you now have it in that position, <strong>and again repeat the element wise products and then adding exercise</strong>. If you do that, you should get negative 10 here. If you shift it one to the right, you should get negative 2 and then 2 and then 3 and so on. Then fill in all the rest of the elements of the matrix.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/10.png" alt=""><br>To be clearer, this -16 would be obtained by from this lower right 3 by 3 region. A 6 by 6 matrix convolve of the 3 by 3 matrix gives you a 4 by 4 matrix. And these are images and filters. These are really just matrices of various dimensions. But <strong>the matrix on the left is convenient to interpret as image, and the one in the middle we interpret as a filter and the one on the right, you can interpret that as maybe another image. And this turns out to be a vertical edge detector, and you see why on the next slide</strong>. Before going on though, just one other comment, which is that if you implement this in a programming language, then in practice, <strong>most foreign languages will have some different functions rather than an asterisk to denote convolution. For example, in the previous exercise, you use or you implement a function called <code>conv-forward</code>in python. If you do this in tensorflow, there is a function <code>tf.nn.cont2d</code>. And then other deep learning programming frameworks in the <code>keras</code> program firmware, we shall see later in this course, there is a function called <code>cont2d</code> that implements convolution and so on.</strong> But all the deep learning frameworks that have a good support for computer vision will have some functions for implementing this convolution operator. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/4.png" alt=""><br>Why is this doing vertical edge detection? Lets look at another example. To illustrate this, we are going to use a simplified image. Here is a simple 6 by 6 image where <strong>the left half of the image is 10 and the right half is zero</strong>. If you plot this as a picture, it might look like this, <strong>where the left half, the 10s, give you brighter pixel intensive values and the right half gives you darker pixel intensive values</strong>. I am using that shade of gray to denote zeros, although maybe it could also be drawn as black. But in this image, there is clearly a very strong vertical edge right down the middle of this image as it transitions from white to black or white to darker color. When you convolve this with the 3 by 3 filter and so <strong>this 3 by 3 filter</strong> can be visualized as follows, where is lighter, <strong>brighter pixels on the left and then this mid tone zeroes in the middle and then darker on the right.</strong> What you get is this matrix on the right. Just to verify this math if you want, this zero for example, is obtained by taking the element wise products and then multiplying with this 3 by 3 block and so you get from the left column 10 plus 10 plus 10 and then zeroes in the middle and then -10, -10, -10 which is why you end up with zero over here. Whereas in contrast, if that 30 will be obtained from this, which you get from having 10 plus 10 plus 10 and then minus zero, minus zero which is why you end up with a 30 over there. <strong>Now, if you plot this rightmost matrix’s image it will look like that where there is this lighter region right in the middle and that corresponds to this having detected this vertical edge down the middle of your 6 by 6 image. In case the dimensions here seem a little bit wrong that the detected edge seems really thick, that’s only because we are working with very small images in this example. And if you are using, say a 1000 by 1000 image rather than a 6 by 6 image then you find that this does a pretty good job, really detecting the vertical edges in your image</strong>. In this example, this bright region in the middle is just the output images way of saying that it looks like there is a strong vertical edge right down the middle of the image. Maybe one intuition to take away from vertical edge detection is that a vertical edge is a three by three region since we are using a 3 by 3 filter where there are bright pixels on the left, you do not care that much what is in the middle and dark pixels on the right. The middle in this 6 by 6 image is really where there could be bright pixels on the left and darker pixels on the right and that is why it thinks its a vertical edge over there. <strong>The convolution operation gives you a convenient way to specify how to find these vertical edges in an image</strong>. </p>
<p>You have now seen how the convolution operator works. In the next video, you will see how to take this and use it as one of the basic building blocks of a Convolution Neural Network.</p>
<h2 id="03-more-edge-detection"><a href="#03-more-edge-detection" class="headerlink" title="03_more-edge-detection"></a>03_more-edge-detection</h2><p>You’ve seen how the convolution operation allows you to implement a vertical edge detector. In this video, you’ll learn the difference between positive and negative edges, that is, the difference between light to dark versus dark to light edge transitions. And you’ll also see other types of edge detectors, as well as how to have an algorithm learn, rather than have us hand code an edge detector as we’ve been doing so far. So let’s get started. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/12.png" alt=""><br>Here’s the example you saw from the previous video, where you have this image, six by six, <strong>there’s light on the left and dark on the right, and convolving it with the vertical edge detection filter results in detecting the vertical edge down the middle of the image</strong>. What happens in an image where the colors are flipped, where it is darker on the left and brighter on the right? So the 10s are now on the right half of the image and the 0s on the left. <strong>If you convolve it with the same edge detection filter</strong>, you end up with negative 30s, instead of 30 down the middle, and you can plot that as a picture that maybe looks like that. <strong>So because the shade of the transitions is reversed</strong>, the 30s now gets reversed as well.** And the negative 30s shows that this is a dark to light rather than a light to dark transition.** And if you don’t care which of these two cases it is, you could take absolute values of this output matrix. <strong>But this particular filter does make a difference between the light to dark versus the dark to light edges</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/13.png" alt=""><br>Let’s see some more examples of edge detection. This three by three filter we’ve seen allows you to detect vertical edges. So maybe it should not surprise you too much that this three by three filter will allow you to detect horizontal edges. So as a reminder, a vertical edge according to this filter, is a three by three region where the pixels are relatively bright on the left part and relatively dark on the right part. So similarly, a <strong>horizontal edge</strong> would be a three by three region where the pixels are relatively bright on top and relatively dark in the bottom row. So here’s one example, this is a more complex one, where you have here 10s in the upper left and lower right-hand corners. So if you draw this as an image, this would be an image which is going to be darker where there are 0s, so I’m going to shade in the darker regions, and then lighter in the upper left and lower right-hand corners. And if you convolve this with a horizontal edge detector, you end up with this. <strong>And so just to take a couple of examples, this 30 here corresponds to this three by three region, where indeed there are bright pixels on top and darker pixels on the bottom. It’s kind of over here. And so it finds a strong positive edge there. And this -30 here corresponds to this region, which is actually brighter on the bottom and darker on top. So that is a negative edge in this example</strong>. And again, this is kind of an artifact of the fact that <strong>we’re working with relatively small images, that this is just a six by six image. But these intermediate values, like this -10, for example, just reflects the fact that that filter here, it captures part of the positive edge on the left and part of the negative edge on the right, and so blending those together gives you some intermediate value. But if this was a very large, say a thousand by a thousand image with this type of checkerboard pattern, then you won’t see these transitions regions of the 10s. The intermediate values would be quite small relative to the size of the image.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/14.png" alt=""><br><strong>So in summary, different filters allow you to find vertical and horizontal edges. It turns out that the three by three vertical edge detection filter we’ve used is just one possible choice</strong>. And historically, in the computer vision literature, there was a fair amount of debate about what is the best set of numbers to use. So here’s something else you could use, which is maybe 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -2, -1. This is called a <strong>Sobel filter</strong>. <strong>And the advantage of this is it puts a little bit more weight to the central row, the central pixel, and this makes it maybe a little bit more robust</strong>. But computer vision researchers will use other sets of numbers as well, like maybe instead of a 1, 2, 1, it should be a 3, 10, 3, right? And then -3, -10, -3. And this is called a <strong>Scharr filter</strong>. And this has yet other slightly different properties. And this is just for vertical edge detection. And if you flip it 90 degrees, you get horizontal edge detection. <strong>And with the rise of deep learning, one of the things we learned is that when you really want to detect edges in some complicated image, maybe you don’t need to have computer vision researchers handpick these nine numbers. Maybe you can just learn them and treat the nine numbers of this matrix as parameters, which you can then learn using back propagation</strong>. And the goal is to learn nine parameters so that when you take the image, the six by six image, and convolve it with your three by three filter, that this gives you a good edge detector. And what you see in later videos is that by just treating these nine numbers as parameters, the backprop can choose to learn 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1,-1, <strong>if it wants, or learn the Sobel filter or learn the Scharr filter, or more likely learn something else that’s even better at capturing the statistics of your data than any of these hand coded filters. And rather than just vertical and horizontal edges, maybe it can learn to detect edges that are at 45 degrees or 70 degrees or 73 degrees or at whatever orientation it chooses. And so by just letting all of these numbers be parameters and learning them automatically from data, we find that neural networks can actually learn low level features, can learn features such as edges, even more robustly than computer vision researchers are generally able to code up these things by hand. But underlying all these computations is still this convolution operation, Which allows back propagation to learn whatever three by three filter it wants and then to apply it throughout the entire image, at this position, at this position, at this position, in order to output whatever feature it’s trying to detect. Be it vertical edges, horizontal edges, or edges at some other angle or even some other filter that we might not even have a name for in English</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>So the idea you can treat these nine numbers as parameters to be learned has been one of the most powerful ideas in computer vision</strong>. And later in this course, later this week, we’ll actually talk about the details of how you actually go about using back propagation to learn these nine numbers. But first, let’s talk about some other details, some other variations, on the basic convolution operation. In the next two videos, I want to discuss with you how to use padding as well as different strides for convolutions. And these two will become important pieces of this convolutional building block of convolutional neural networks. So let’s go on to the next video.</p>
<h2 id="04-padding"><a href="#04-padding" class="headerlink" title="04_padding"></a>04_padding</h2><p>In order to build deep neural networks one modification to the basic convolutional operation that you need to really use is padding. Let’s see how it works. What we saw in earlier videos is that if you take a six by six image and convolve it with a three by three filter, you end up with a four by four output with a four by four matrix, and that’s because the number of possible positions with the three by three filter, there are only, sort of, four by four possible positions, for the three by three filter to fit in your six by six matrix. And the math of this this turns out to be that if you have a end by end image and to involved that with an f by f filter, then the dimension of the output will be; n minus f plus one by n minus f plus one. And in this example, six minus three plus one is equal to four, which is why you wound up with a four by four output. <strong>So the two downsides to this; one is that, if every time you apply a convolutional operator, your image shrinks, so you come from six by six down to four by four then, you can only do this a few times before your image starts getting really small, maybe it shrinks down to one by one or something, so maybe, you don’t want your image to shrink every time you detect edges or to set other features on it, so that’s one downside, and the second downside is that, if you look the pixel at the corner or the edge, this little pixel is touched as used only in one of the outputs, because this touches that three by three region. Whereas, if you take a pixel in the middle, say this pixel, then there are a lot of three by three regions that overlap that pixel and so, is as if pixels on the corners or on the edges are use much less in the output. So you’re throwing away a lot of the information near the edge of the image</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/15.png" alt=""><br>So, to solve both of these problems, both the shrinking output, and when you build really deep neural networks, you see why you don’t want the image to shrink on every step because <strong>if you have, maybe a hundred layer of deep net, then it’ll shrinks a bit on every layer, then after a hundred layers you end up with a very small image. So that was one problem, the other is throwing away a lot of the information from the edges of the image. So in order to fix both of these problems</strong>, what you can do is the full apply of convolutional operation. <strong>You can pad the image. So in this case, let’s say you pad the image with an additional one border, with the additional border of one pixel all around the edges.</strong> So, if you do that, then instead of a six by six image, you’ve now padded this to eight by eight image and if you convolve an eight by eight image with a three by three image you now get that out. Now, the ouput is the four by four by the six by six image, so you managed to preserve the original input size of six by six. So by convention when you pad, you padded with zeros and if p is the padding amounts. So in this case, p is equal to one, because we’re padding all around with an extra boarder of one pixels, then the output becomes n plus 2p minus f plus one by n plus 2p minus f by one. So, this becomes six plus two times one minus three plus one by the same thing on that. So, six plus two minus three plus one that’s equals to six. So you end up with a six by six image that preserves the size of the original image. <strong>So this being pixel actually influences all of these cells of the output and so this effective, maybe not by throwing away but counting less the information from the edge of the corner or the edge of the image is reduced</strong>. And I’ve shown here, the effect of padding deep border with just one pixel. If you want, you can also pad the border with two pixels, in which case I guess, you do add on another border here and they can pad it with even more pixels if you choose. So, I guess what I’m drawing here, this would be a padded equals to p plus two. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/16.png" alt=""><br>In terms of how much to pad, it turns out there two common choices that are called, <strong>Valid convolutions and Same convolutions</strong>. Not really is a great names but in a <strong>valid convolution, this basically means no padding</strong>. And so in this case you might have n by n image convolve with an f by f filter and this would give you an n minus f plus one by n minus f plus one dimensional output. So this is like the example we had previously on the previous videos where we had an n by n image convolve with the three by three filter and that gave you a four by four output. <strong>The other most common choice of padding is called the same convolution and that means when you pad, so the output size is the same as the input size.</strong> So if we actually look at this formula, when you pad by p pixels then, its as if n goes to n plus 2p and then you have from the rest of this, right? Minus f plus one. So we have an n by n image and the padding of a border of p pixels all around, then the output sizes of this dimension is xn plus 2p minus f plus one. And so, if you want n plus 2p minus f plus one to be equal to one, so the output size is same as input size, if you take this and solve for, I guess, n cancels out on both sides and if you solve for p, this implies that p is equal to f minus one over two. So when f is odd, by choosing the padding size to be as follows, you can make sure that the output size is same as the input size and that’s why, for example, when the filter was three by three as this had happened in the previous slide, the padding that would make the output size the same as the input size was three minus one over two, which is one. And as another example, if your filter was five by five, so if f is equal to five, then, if you pad it into that equation you find that the padding of two is required to keep the output size the same as the input size when the filter is five by five. <strong>And by convention in computer vision, f is usually odd. It’s actually almost always odd and you rarely see even numbered filters, filter works using computer vision. And I think that two reasons for that; one is that if f was even, then you need some asymmetric padding. So only if f is odd that this type of same convolution gives a natural padding region, had the same dimension all around rather than pad more on the left and pad less on the right, or something that asymmetric. And then second, when you have an odd dimension filter, such as three by three or five by five, then it has a central position and sometimes in computer vision its nice to have a distinguisher, it’s nice to have a pixel, you can call the central pixel so you can talk about the position of the filter. Right, maybe none of this is a great reason for using f to be pretty much always odd but if you look a convolutional literature you see three by three filters are very common. You see some five by five, seven by sevens. And actually sometimes, later we’ll also talk about one by one filters and that why that makes sense. But just by convention, I recommend you just use odd number filters as well. I think that you can probably get just fine performance even if you want to use an even number value for f, but if you stick to the common computer vision convention, I usually just use odd number f</strong>. </p>
<p>So you’ve now seen how to use padded convolutions. To specify the padding for your convolution operation, you can either specify the value for p or you can just say that this is a valid convolution, which means p equals zero or you can say this is a same convolution, which means pad as much as you need to make sure the output has same dimension as the input. So that’s it for padding. In the next video, let’s talk about how you can implement Strided convolutions.</p>
<h2 id="05-strided-convolutions"><a href="#05-strided-convolutions" class="headerlink" title="05_strided-convolutions"></a>05_strided-convolutions</h2><p><strong>Strided convolutions</strong> is another piece of the basic building block of convolutions as used in Convolutional Neural Networks. </p>
<p>Let me show you an example. Let’s say you want to convolve this seven by seven image with this three by three filter, except that <strong>instead of doing the usual way, we are going to do it with a stride of two</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/17.png" alt=""><br>What that means is you take the element Y’s product as usual in this upper left three by three region and then multiply and add and that gives you 91. But then instead of stepping the blue box over by one step, we are going to step over by two steps. So, we are going to make it hop over two steps like so. Notice how the upper left hand corner has gone from this start to this start, jumping over one position. And then you do the usual element Y’s product and summing it turns out 100.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/18.png" alt=""><br>And now we are going to do they do that again, and make the blue box jump over by two steps. You end up there, and that gives you 83.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/19.png" alt=""><br>Now, when you go to the next row, you again actually take two steps instead of one step so going to move the blue box over there. Notice how we are stepping over one of the positions and then this gives you 69 and now you again step over two steps, this gives you 91 and so on so 127. And then for the final row 44, 72, and 74.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/20.png" alt=""><br>In this example, we convolve with a seven by seven matrix to this three by three matrix and we get a three by three outputs. The input and output dimensions turns out to be governed by the following formula, if you have an N by N image, they convolve with an F by F filter. And if you use padding P and stride S. In this example, S is equal to two then you end up with an output that is N plus two P minus F, and now because you’re stepping S steps of the time, you step just one step of the time, you now divide by S plus one and then can apply the same thing. In our example, we have seven plus zero, minus three, divided by two S stride plus one equals let’s see, that’s four over two plus one equals three, which is why we wound up with this is three by three output.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/21.png" alt=""><br>Now, just one last detail which is what of this fraction is not an integer? In that case, we’re going to round this down so this notation denotes the flow of something. This is also called <strong>the floor of Z. It means taking Z and rounding down to the nearest integer</strong>. The way this is implemented is that you take this type of blue box multiplication only if the blue box is fully contained within the image or the image plus to the padding and if any of this blue box kind of part of it hangs outside and you just do not do that computation. Then it turns out that if that’s the convention that your three by three filter, must lie entirely within your image or the image plus the padding region before there’s as a corresponding output generated that’s convention. Then the right thing to do to compute the output dimension is to round down in case this N plus two P minus F over S is not an integer. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/22.png" alt=""><br>Just to summarize the dimensions, if you have an N by N matrix or N by N image that you convolve with an F by F matrix or F by F filter with padding P N stride S, then the output size will have this dimension. It is nice we can choose all of these numbers so that there is an integer although sometimes you don’t have to do that and rounding down is just fine as well. But please feel free to work through a few examples of values of N, F, P and S on yourself to convince yourself if you want, that this formula is correct for the output size. </p>
<p>Now, before moving on there is a technical comment I want to make about <strong>cross-correlation versus convolutions</strong> and just for the facts what you have to do to implement convolutional neural networks. If you reading different math textbook or signal processing textbook, there is one other possible inconsistency in the notation which is that, if you look at the typical math textbook, the way that the convolution is defined before doing the element Y’s product and summing, there’s actually one other step that you’ll first take which is to convolve this six by six matrix with this three by three filter. You at first take the three by three filter and slip it on the horizontal as well as the vertical axis so this 345102 minus 197, will become, three goes here, four goes there, five goes there and then the second row becomes this,102 minus 197. Well, this is really taking the three by three filter and narrowing it both on the vertical and horizontal axes. And then it was this flit matrix that you would then copy over here. To compute the output, you will take two times seven, plus three times two, plus seven times five and so on. I should multiply out the elements of this flit matrix in order to compute the upper left hand rows elements of the four by four output as follows. Then you take those nine numbers and shift them over by one shift them over by one and so on. The way we’ve define the convolution operation in this video is that we’ve skipped this narrowing operation. <strong>Technically, what we’re actually doing, the operation we’ve been using for the last few videos is sometimes cross-correlation instead of convolution. But in the deep learning literature by convention, we just call this a convolutional operation.</strong> Just to summarize, by convention in machine learning, we usually do not bother with this skipping operation and technically, this operation is maybe better called cross-correlation but most of the deep learning literature just calls it the convolution operator. <strong>And so I’m going to use that convention in these videos as well, and if you read a lot of the machines learning literature, you’ll find most people just call this the convolution operator without bothering to use these slips.</strong> It turns out that in signal processing or in certain branches of mathematics, doing the flipping in the definition of convolution causes convolution operator to enjoy this property that A convolve with B, convolve with C is equal to A convolve with B, convolve with C, and this is called associativity in mathematics. This is nice for some signal processing applications but for deep neural networks it really doesn’t matter and <strong>so omitting this double mirroring operation just simplifies the code and makes the neural networks work just as well. And by convention, most of us just call this convolution or even though the mathematicians prefer to call this cross-correlation sometimes. But this should not affect anything you have to implement in the problem exercises and should not affect your ability to read and understand the deep learning literature</strong>. </p>
<p>So you’ve now seen how to carry out convolutions and you’ve seen how to use padding as well as strides to convolutions. But so far, all we’ve been using is convolutions over matrices, like over a six by six matrix. In the next video, you’ll see how to carry out convolutions over volumes and this would make what you can do a convolutions sounds really much more powerful. Let’s go on to the next video.</p>
<h2 id="06-convolutions-over-volume"><a href="#06-convolutions-over-volume" class="headerlink" title="06_convolutions-over-volume"></a>06_convolutions-over-volume</h2><p>You’ve seen how convolutions over 2D images works. Now, let’s see how you can implement convolutions over, not just 2D images, but over three dimensional volumes. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/23.png" alt=""><br>Let’s start with an example, let’s say you want to detect features, not just in a great scale image, but in a RGB image. So, an RGB image might be instead of a six by six image, it could be six by six by three, where the three here responds to the three color channels. So, you think of this as a stack of three six by six images. In order to detect edges or some other feature in this image, you can vault this, not with a three by three filter, as we have previously, but now with also with a 3D filter, that’s going to be three by three by three. So the filter itself will also have three layers corresponding to the red, green, and blue channels. So to give these things some names, this first six here, that’s the height of the image, that’s the width, and this three is the number of channels. And your filter also similarly has a height, a width, and the number of channels. <strong>And the number of channels in your image must match the number of channels in your filter, so these two numbers have to be equal</strong>. We’ll see on the next slide how this convolution operation actually works, but the output of this will be a four by four image. And notice this is four by four by one, there’s no longer a three at the end. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/24.png" alt=""><br>Let’s go through in detail how this works but let’s use a more nicely drawn image. So here’s the six by six by three image, and here’s a three by three by three filter, and this last number, the number of channels matches the 3D image and the filter. So to simplify the drawing of this three by three by three filter, instead of joining it is a stack of the matrices, I’m also going to, sometimes, just draw it as this three dimensional cube, like that. So to compute the output of this convolutional operation, what you would do is take the three by three by three filter and first, place it in that upper left most position. <strong>So, notice that this three by three by three filter has 27 numbers, or 27 parameters, that’s three cubes. And so, what you do is take each of these 27 numbers and multiply them with the corresponding numbers from the red, green, and blue channels of the image, so take the first nine numbers from red channel, then the three beneath it to the green channel, then the three beneath it to the blue channel, and multiply it with the corresponding 27 numbers that gets covered by this yellow cube show on the left. Then add up all those numbers and this gives you this first number in the output, and then to compute the next output you take this cube and slide it over by one, and again, due to 27 multiplications, add up the 27 numbers, that gives you this next output, do it for the next number over, for the next position over, that gives the third output and so on</strong>. That gives you the forth and then one row down and then the next one, to the next one, to the next one, and so on, you get the idea, until at the very end, that’s the position you’ll have for that final output. <strong>So, what does this allow you to do? Well</strong>, here’s an example, this filter is three by three by three. <strong>So, if you want to detect edges in the red channel of the image, then you could have the first filter, the one, one, one, one is one, one is one, one is one as usual, and have the green channel be all zeros, and have the blue filter be all zeros. And if you have these three stock together to form your three by three by three filter, then this would be a filter that detect edges, vertical edges but only in the red channel. Alternatively, if you don’t care what color the vertical edge is in, then you might have a filter that’s like this, whereas this one, one, one, minus one, minus one, minus one, in all three channels. So, by setting this second alternative, set the parameters, you then have a edge detector, a three by three by three edge detector, that detects edges in any color</strong>. </p>
<p>And with different choices of these parameters you can get different feature detectors out of this three by three by three filter. And by convention, in computer vision, when you have an input with a certain height, a certain width, and a certain number of channels, then your filter will have a potential different height, different width, but the same number of channels. And in theory it’s possible to have a filter that maybe only looks at the red channel or maybe a filter looks at only the green channel and a blue channel. And once again, you notice that convolving a volume, a six by six by three convolve with a three by three by three, that gives a four by four, a 2D output. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/25.png" alt=""><br>Now that you know how to convolve on volumes, there is one last idea that will be crucial for building convolutional neural networks, which is what if we don’t just wanted to detect vertical edges? <strong>What if we wanted to detect vertical edges and horizontal edges and maybe 45 degree edges and maybe 70 degree edges as well, but in other words, what if you want to use multiple filters at the same time</strong>? So, here’s the picture we had from the previous slide, we had six by six by three convolved with the three by three by three, gets four by four, and <strong>maybe this is a vertical edge detector, or maybe it’s run to detect some other feature. Now, maybe a second filter may be denoted by this orange color, which could be a horizontal edge detector. So, maybe convolving it with the first filter gives you this first four by four output and convolving with the second filter gives you a different four by four output. And what we can do is then take these two four by four outputs, take this first one within the front and you can take this second filter output and well, let me draw it here, put it at back as follows, so that by stacking these two together, you end up with a four by four by two output volume</strong>, right? And you can think of the volume as if we draw this is a box, I guess it would look like this. So this would be a four by four by two output volume, which is the result of taking your six by six by three image and convolving it or applying two different three by three filters to it, resulting in two four by four outputs that then gets stacked up to form a four by four by two volume. And the two here comes from the fact that we used two different filters. So, let’s just summarize the dimensions, if you have a n by n by number of channels input image, so an example, there’s a six by six by three, where n subscript C is the number of channels, and you convolve that with a f by f by, and again, this should be the same nC, so this was, three by three by three, and by convention this and this have to be the same number. Then, what you get is n minus f plus one by n minus f plus one by and you want to use this nC prime, or its really nC of the next layer, but this is the number of filters that you use. So this in our example would be be four by four by two. And <strong>I wrote this assuming that you use a stride of one and no padding</strong>. But if you used a different stride of padding than this n minus F plus one would be affected in a usual way, as we see in the previous videos. <strong>So this idea of convolution on volumes, turns out to be really powerful. Only a small part of it is that you can now operate directly on RGB images with three channels. But even more important is that you can now detect two features, like vertical, horizontal edges, or 10, or maybe a 128, or maybe several hundreds of different features. And the output will then have a number of channels equal to the number of filters you are detecting. And as a note of notation, I’ve been using your number of channels to denote this last dimension in the literature, people will also often call this the depth of this 3D volume and both notations, channels or depth, are commonly used in the literature. But they find depth more confusing because you usually talk about the depth of the neural network as well, so I’m going to use the term channels in these videos to refer to the size of this third dimension of these filters</strong>. </p>
<p>So now that you know how to implement convolutions over volumes, you now are ready to implement one layer of the convolutional neural network. Let’s see how to do that in the next video.</p>
<h2 id="07-one-layer-of-a-convolutional-network"><a href="#07-one-layer-of-a-convolutional-network" class="headerlink" title="07_one-layer-of-a-convolutional-network"></a>07_one-layer-of-a-convolutional-network</h2><p>Get now ready to see how to build one layer of a convolutional neural network, let’s go through the example. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/26.png" alt=""><br>You’ve seen at the previous video how to take a 3D volume and convolve it with say two different filters. In order to get in this example to different 4 by 4 outputs. So let’s say convolving with the first filter gives this first 4 by 4 output, and convolving with this second filter gives a different 4 by 4 output. The final thing to turn this into a convolutional neural net layer, is that for each of these we’re going to add it bias, so this is going to be a real number. And where python broadcasting, you kind of have to add the same number so every one of these 16 elements. And then apply a non-linearity which for this illustration that says relative non-linearity, and this gives you a 4 by 4 output, all right? After applying the bias and the non-linearity. And then for this thing at the bottom as well, you add some different bias, again, this is a real number. So you add the single number to all 16 numbers, and then apply some non-linearity, let’s say a real non-linearity. And this gives you a different 4 by 4 output. Then same as we did before, if we take this and stack it up as follows, so we ends up with a 4 by 4 by 2 outputs. Then this computation where you come from a 6 by 6 by 3 to 4 by 4 by 4, this is one layer of a convolutional neural network. So to map this back to one layer of four propagation in the standard neural network, in a non-convolutional neural network. Remember that one step before the prop was something like this, right? z1 = w1 times a0, a 0 was also equal to x, and then plus b[1]. And you apply the non-linearity to get a[1], so that’s g(z[1]). So this input here, in this analogy this is a[0], this is x3. And these filters here, this plays a role similar to w1. And you remember during the convolution operation, you were taking these 27 numbers, or really well, 27 times 2, because you have two filters. You’re taking all of these numbers and multiplying them. So you’re really computing a linear function to get this 4 x 4 matrix. So that 4 x 4 matrix, the output of the convolution operation, that plays a rolesimilar to w1 times a0. That’s really maybe the output of this 4 x 4 as well as that 4 x 4. And then the other thing you do is add the bias. So, this thing here before applying value, this plays a role similar to z. And then it’s finally by applying the non-linearity, this kind of this I guess. So, this output plays a role, this really becomes your activation at the next layer. So this is how you go from a0 to a1, as far as tthe linear operation and then convolution has all these multipled. So the convolution is really applying a linear operation and you have the biases and the applied value operation. And you’ve gone from a 6 by 6 by 3, dimensional a0, through one layer of neural network to, I guess a 4 by 4 by 2 dimensional a(1). And so 6 by 6 by 3 has gone to 4 by 4 by 2, and so that is one layer of convolutional net. Now in this example we have two filters, so we had two features of you will, which is why we wound up with our output 4 by 4 by 2. But if for example we instead had 10 filters instead of 2, then we would have wound up with the 4 by 4 by 10 dimensional output volume. Because we’ll be taking 10 of these naps not just two of them, and stacking them up to form a 4 by 4 by 10 output volume, and that’s what a1 would be. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/27.png" alt=""><br>So, to make sure you understand this, let’s go through an exercise. Let’s suppose you have 10 filters, not just two filters, that are 3 by 3 by 3 and 1 layer of a neural network, how many parameters does this layer have? Well, let’s figure this out. Each filter, is a 3 x 3 x 3 volume, so 3 x 3 x 3, so each fill has 27 parameters, all right? There’s 27 numbers to be run, and plus the bias. So that was the b parameter, so this gives you 28 parameters. And then if you imagine that on the previous slide we had drawn two filters, but now if you imagine that you actually have ten of these, right? 1, 2…, 10 of these, then all together you’ll have 28 times 10, so that will be 280 parameters. Notice one nice thing about this, is that no matter how big the input image is, the input image could be 1,000 by 1,000 or 5,000 by 5,000, but the number of parameters you have still remains fixed as 280. And you can use these ten filters to detect features, vertical edges, horizontal edges maybe other features anywhere even in a very, very large image is just a very small number of parameters. So these is really one property of convolution neural network that makes less prone to overfitting then if you could. So once you’ve learned 10 feature detectors that work, you could apply this even to large images. And the number of parameters still is fixed and relatively small, as 280 in this example. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/28.png" alt=""><br>All right, so to wrap up this video let’s just summarize the notation we are going to use to describe one layer to describe a covolutional layer in a convolutional neural network. So layer l is a convolution layer, l am going to use f superscript,[l] to denote the filter size. So previously we’ve been seeing the filters are f by f, and now this superscript square bracket l just denotes that this is a filter size of f by f filter layer l. And as usual the superscript square bracket l is the notation we’re using to refer to particular layer l. going to use p[l] to denote the amount of padding. And again, the amount of padding can also be specified just by saying that you want a valid convolution, which means no padding, or a same convolution which means you choose the padding. So that the output size has the same height and width as the input size. And then you’re going to use s[l] to denote the stride. Now, the input to this layer is going to be some dimension. It’s going be some n by n by number of channels in the previous layer. Now, I’m going to modify this notation a little bit. I’m going to us superscript l- 1, because that’s the activation from the previous layer, l- 1 times nc of l- 1. And in the example so far, we’ve been just using images of the same height and width. That in case the height and width might differ, l am going to use superscript h and superscript w, to denote the height and width of the input of the previous layer, all right? So in layer l, the size of the volume will be nh by nw by nc with superscript squared bracket l. It’s just in layer l, the input to this layer Is whatever you had for the previous layer, so that’s why you have l- 1 there. And then this layer of the neural network will itself output the value. So that will be nh of l by nw of l, by nc of l, that will be the size of the output. And so whereas we approve this set that the output volume size or at least the height and weight is given by this formula, n + 2p- f over s + 1, and then take the full of that and round it down. In this new notation what we have is that the outputs value that’s in layer l, is going to be the dimension from the previous layer, plus the padding we’re using in this layer l, minus the filter size we’re using this layer l and so on. And technically this is true for the height, right? So the height of the output volume is given by this, and you can compute it with this formula on the right, and the same is true for the width as well. So you cross out h and throw in w as well, then the same formula with either the height or the width plugged in for computing the height or width of the output value. So that’s how nhl -1 relates to nhl and wl- 1 relates to nwl. Now, how about the number of channels, where did those numbers come from? Let’s take a look, if the output volume has this depth, while we know from the previous examples that that’s equal to the number of filters we have in that layer, right? So we had two filters, the output value was 4 by 4 by 2, was 2 dimensional. And if you had 10 filters and your upper volume was 4 by 4 by 10. So, this the number of channels in the output value, that’s just the number of filters we’re using in this layer of the neural network. Next, how about the size of this filter? Well, each filter is going to be fl by fl by 100 number, right? So what is this last number? Well, we saw that you needed to convolve a 6 by 6 by 3 image, with a 3 by 3 by 3 filter. And so the number of channels in your filter, must match the number of channels in your input, so this number should match that number, right? Which is why each filter is going to be f(l) by f(l) by nc(l-1). And the output of this layer often apply devices in non-linearity, is going to be the activations of this layer al. And that we’ve already seen will be this dimension, right? The al will be a 3D volume, that’s nHl by nwl by ncl. And when you are using a vectorized implementation or batch gradient descent or mini batch gradient descent, then you actually outputs Al, which is a set of m activations, if you have m examples. So that would be M by nHl, by nwl by ncl right? If say you’re using bash grading decent and in the programming sizes this will be ordering of the variables. And we have the index and the trailing examples first, and then these three variables. Next how about the weights or the parameters, or kind of the w parameter? Well we saw already what the filter dimension is. So the filters are going to be f[l] by f[l] by nc [l- 1], but that’s the dimension of one filter. How many filters do we have? Well, this is a total number of filters, so the weights really all of the filters put together will have dimension given by this, times the total number of filters, right? Because this, Last quantity is the number of filters, In layer l. And then finally, you have the bias parameters, and you have one bias parameter, one real number for each filter. So you’re going to have, the bias will have this many variables, it’s just a vector of this dimension. Although later on we’ll see that the code will be more convenient represented as 1 by 1 by 1 by nc[l] four dimensional matrix, or four dimensional tensor. </p>
<p><strong>So I know that was a lot of notation, and this is the convention I’ll use for the most part. I just want to mention in case you search online and look at open source code. There isn’t a completely universal standard convention about the ordering of height, width, and channel. So If you look on source code on GitHub or these open source implementations, you’ll find that some authors use this order instead, where you first put the channel first, and you sometimes see that ordering of the variables. And in fact in some common frameworks, actually in multiple common frameworks, there’s actually a variable or a parameter. Why do you want to list the number of channels first, or list the number of channels last when indexing into these volumes. I think both of these conventions work okay, so long as you’re consistent. And unfortunately maybe this is one piece of annotation where there isn’t consistency in the deep learning literature but i’m going to use this convention for these videos. Where we list height and width and then the number of channels last</strong>. </p>
<p>So I know there was suddenly a lot of new notations you could use, but you’re thinking wow, that’s a long notation, how do I need to remember all of these? Don’t worry about it, you don’t need to remember all of this notation, and through this week’s exercises you become more familiar with it at that time. But the key point I hope you take a way from this video, is just one layer of how convolutional neural network works. And the computations involved in taking the activations of one layer and mapping that to the activations of the next layer. And next, now that you know how one layer of the compositional neural network works, let’s stack a bunch of these together to actually form a deeper compositional neural network. Let’s go on to the next video to see.</p>
<h2 id="08-simple-convolutional-network-example"><a href="#08-simple-convolutional-network-example" class="headerlink" title="08_simple-convolutional-network-example"></a>08_simple-convolutional-network-example</h2><p>In the last video, you saw the building blocks of a single layer, of a single convolution layer in the ConvNet. Now let’s go through a concrete example of a deep convolutional neural network. And this will give you some practice with the notation that we introduced toward the end of the last video as well. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/29.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say you have an image, and you want to do image classification, or image recognition. Where you want to take as input an image, x, and decide is this a cat or not, 0 or 1, so it’s a classification problem. Let’s build an example of a ConvNet you could use for this task. For the sake of this example, I’m going to use a fairly small image. Let’s say this image is 39 x 39 x 3. This choice just makes some of the numbers work out a bit better. And so, nH in layer 0 will be equal to nw height and width are equal to 39 and the number of channels and layer 0 is equal to 3. Let’s say the first layer uses a set of 3 by 3 filters to detect features, so f = 3 or really f1 = 3, because we’re using a 3 by 3 process. And let’s say we’re using a stride of 1, and no padding. So using a same convolution, and let’s say you have 10 filters. Then the activations in this next layer of the neutral network will be 37 x 37 x 10, and this 10 comes from the fact that you use 10 filters. And 37 comes from this formula n + 2p- f over s + 1. Right, then I guess you have 39 + 0- 3 over 1 + 1 that’s = to 37. So that’s why the output is 37 by 37, it’s a valid convolution and that’s the output size. So in our notation you would have nh[1] = nw[1] = 37 and nc[1] = 10, so nc[1] is also equal to the number of filters from the first layer. And so this becomes the dimension of the activation at the first layer. Let’s say you now have another convolutional layer and let’s say this time you use 5 by 5 filters. So, in our notation f[2] at the next neural network = 5, and let’s say use a stride of 2 this time. And maybe you have no padding and say, 20 filters. So then the output of this will be another volume, this time it will be 17 x 17 x 20. Notice that, because you’re now using a stride of 2, the dimension has shrunk much faster. 37 x 37 has gone down in size by slightly more than a factor of 2, to 17 x 17. And because you’re using 20 filters, the number of channels now is 20. So it’s this activation a2 would be that dimension and so nh[2] = nw[2] = 17 and nc[2] = 20. All right, let’s apply one last convolutional layer. So let’s say that you use a 5 by 5 filter again, and again, a stride of 2. So if you do that, I’ll skip the math, but you end up with a 7 x 7, and let’s say you use 40 filters, no padding, 40 filters. You end up with 7 x 7 x 40. So now what you’ve done is taken your 39 x 39 x 3 input image and computed your 7 x 7 x 40 features for this image. And then finally, what’s commonly done is if you take this 7 x 7 x 40, 7 times 7 times 40 is actually 1,960. And so what we can do is take this volume and flatten it or unroll it into just 1,960 units, right? Just flatten it out into a vector, and then feed this to a logistic regression unit, or a softmax unit. Depending on whether you’re trying to recognize or trying to recognize any one of key different objects and then just have this give the final predicted output for the neural network. So just be clear, this last step is just taking all of these numbers, all 1,960 numbers, and unrolling them into a very long vector. So then you just have one long vector that you can feed into softmax until it’s just a regression in order to make prediction for the final output. So this would be a pretty typical example of a ConvNet. A lot of the work in designing convolutional neural net is selecting hyperparameters like these, deciding what’s the total size? What’s the stride? What’s the padding and how many filters are used? And both later this week as well as next week, we’ll give some suggestions and some guidelines on how to make these choices. But for now, maybe one thing to take away from this is that as you go deeper in a neural network, typically you start off with larger images, 39 by 39. <strong>And then the height and width will stay the same for a while and gradually trend down as you go deeper in the neural network. It’s gone from 39 to 37 to 17 to 7. Whereas the number of channels will generally increase. It’s gone from 3 to 10 to 20 to 40, and you see this general trend in a lot of other convolutional neural networks as well.</strong> So we’ll get more guidelines about how to design these parameters in later videos. But you’ve now seen your first example of a convolutional neural network, or a ConvNet for short. So congratulations on that. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/30.png" alt=""><br><strong>And it turns out that in a typical ConvNet, there are usually three types of layers. One is the convolutional layer, and often we’ll denote that as a Conv layer</strong>. And that’s what we’ve been using in the previous network. <strong>It turns out that there are two other common types of layers that you haven’t seen yet but we’ll talk about in the next couple of videos. One is called a pooling layer, often I’ll call this pool. And then the last is a fully connected layer called FC</strong>. And although it’s possible to design a pretty good neural network using just convolutional layers, most neural network architectures will also have a few pooling layers and a few fully connected layers. <strong>Fortunately pooling layers and fully connected layers are a bit simpler than convolutional layers to define</strong>. So we’ll do that quickly in the next two videos and then you have a sense of all of the most common types of layers in a convolutional neural network. And you will put together even more powerful networks than the one we just saw. </p>
<p>So congrats again on seeing your first full convolutional neural network. We’ll also talk later in this week about how to train these networks, but first let’s talk briefly about pooling and fully connected layers. And then training these, we’ll be using back propagation, which you’re already familiar with. But in the next video, let’s quickly go over how to implement a pooling layer for your ConvNet.</p>
<h2 id="09-pooling-layers"><a href="#09-pooling-layers" class="headerlink" title="09_pooling-layers"></a>09_pooling-layers</h2><p>Other than convolutional layers, <strong>ConvNets often also use pooling layers to reduce the size of the representation, to speed the computation, as well as make some of the features that detects a bit more robust</strong>. Let’s take a look. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/31.png" alt=""><br>Let’s go through an example of pooling, and then we’ll talk about why you might want to do this. Suppose you have a four by four input, and you want to apply a type of pooling called max pooling. And the output of this particular implementation of max pooling will be a two by two output. And the way you do that is quite simple. Take your four by four input and break it into different regions and I’m going to color the four regions as follows. And then, in the output, which is two by two, each of the outputs will just be the max from the corresponding reshaded region. So the upper left, I guess, the max of these four numbers is nine. On upper right, the max of the blue numbers is two. Lower left, the biggest number is six, and lower right, the biggest number is three. So to compute each of the numbers on the right, we took the max over a two by two regions. So, this is as if you apply a filter size of two because you’re taking a two by two regions and you’re taking a stride of two. So, these are actually the hyperparameters of max pooling because we start from this filter size. It’s like a two by two region that gives you the nine. And then, you step all over two steps to look at this region, to give you the two, and then for the next row, you step it down two steps to give you the six, and then step to the right by two steps to give you three. So because the squares are two by two, f is equal to two, and because you stride by two, s is equal to two. So here’s the intuition behind what max pooling is doing. If you think of this four by four region as some set of features, the activations in some layer of the neural network, then a large number, it means that it’s maybe detected a particular feature. So, the upper left-hand quadrant has this particular feature. It maybe a vertical edge or maybe a higher or whisker if you trying to detect a [inaudible]. Clearly, that feature exists in the upper left-hand quadrant. Whereas this feature, maybe it isn’t cat eye detector. Whereas this feature, it doesn’t really exist in the upper right-hand quadrant. So what the max operation does is a lots of features detected anywhere, and one of these quadrants , it then remains preserved in the output of max pooling. <strong>So, what the max operates to does is really to say, if these features detected anywhere in this filter, then keep a high number. But if this feature is not detected, so maybe this feature doesn’t exist in the upper right-hand quadrant. Then the max of all those numbers is still itself quite small. So maybe that’s the intuition behind max pooling</strong>. But I have to admit, I think the main reason people use max pooling is because it’s been found in a lot of experiments to work well, and the intuition I just described, despite it being often cited, I don’t know of anyone fully knows if that is the real underlying reason. I don’t have anyone knows if that’s the real underlying reason that max pooling works well in ConvNets. <strong>One interesting property of max pooling is that it has a set of hyperparameters but it has no parameters to learn. There’s actually nothing for gradient descent to learn. Once you fix f and s, it’s just a fixed computation and gradient descent doesn’t change anything</strong>. </p>
<p>Let’s go through an example with some different hyperparameters. Here, I am going to use, sure you have a five by five input and we’re going to apply max pooling with a filter size that’s three by three. So f is equal to three and let’s use a stride of one.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/32.png" alt=""><br>So in this case, the output size is going to be three by three. And the formulas we had developed in the previous videos for figuring out the output size for conv layer, those formulas also work for max pooling. So, that’s n plus 2p minus f over s plus 1. That formula also works for figuring out the output size of max pooling. But in this example, let’s compute each of the elements of this three by three output. The upper left-hand elements, we’re going to look over that region. So notice this is a three by three region because the filter size is three and to the max there. So, that will be nine, and then we shifted over by one because which you can stride at one. So, that max in the blue box is nine. Let’s shift that over again. The max of the blue box is five. And then let’s go on to the next row, a stride of one. So we’re just stepping down by one step. So max in that region is nine, max in that region is nine, max in that region, it’s now with a two fives, we have maxes of five. And then finally, max in that is eight. Max in that is six, and max in that, this is not [inaudible]. Okay, so this, with this set of hyperparameters f equals three, s equals one gives that output shown [inaudible]. Now, so far, I’ve shown max pooling on a 2D inputs. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/33.png" alt=""><br>If you have a <strong>3D input</strong>, then the outputs will have the same dimension. So for example, if you have five by five by two, then the output will be three by three by two and <strong>the way you compute max pooling is you perform the computation we just described on each of the channels independently</strong>. So the first channel which is shown here on top is still the same, and then for the second channel, I guess, this one that I just drew at the bottom, you would do the same computation on that slice of this value and that gives you the second slice. And more generally, if this was five by five by some number of channels, the output would be three by three by that same number of channels. <strong>And the max pooling computation is done independently on each of these $N_C$ channels</strong>. So, that’s max pooling. </p>
<p>This one is the type of pooling that isn’t used very often, but I’ll mention briefly which is <strong>average pooling</strong>. So it does pretty much what you’d expect which is, instead of taking the maxes within each filter, you take the average. So in this example, the average of the numbers in purple is 3.75, then there is 1.25, and four and two. And so, this is average pooling with hyperparameters f equals two, s equals two, we can choose other hyperparameters as well. So these days, max pooling is used much more often than average pooling with one exception, which is sometimes very deep in a neural network. You might use average pooling to collapse your representation from say, 7 by 7 by 1,000. An average over all the spacial extents, you get 1 by 1 by 1,000. We’ll see an example of this later. But you see, <strong>max pooling used much more in the neural network than average pooling</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/34.png" alt=""><br>So just to summarize, the hyperparameters for pooling are f, the filter size and s, the stride, and maybe common choices of parameters might be f equals two, s equals two. This is used quite often and this has the effect of roughly shrinking the height and width by a factor of above two, and a common chosen hyperparameters might be f equals two, s equals two, and this has the effect of shrinking the height and width of the representation by a factor of two. I’ve also seen f equals three, s equals two used, and then the other hyperparameter is just like a binary bit that says, are you using max pooling or are you using average pooling. If you want, you can add an extra hyperparameter for the padding although this is very, very rarely used. When you do max pooling, usually, you do not use any padding, although there is one exception that we’ll see next week as well. But for the most parts of max pooling, usually, it does not use any padding. So, the most common value of p by far is p equals zero. And the input of max pooling is that you input a volume of size that, N_H by N_W by N_C, and it would output a volume of size given by this. So assuming there’s no padding by N_W minus f over s, this one for by N_C. <strong>So the number of input channels is equal to the number of output channels because pooling applies to each of your channels independently. One thing to note about pooling is that there are no parameters to learn</strong>. So, when we implement that crop, you find that there are no parameters that backdrop will adapt through max pooling. Instead, <strong>there are just these hyperparameters that you set once, maybe set ones by hand or set using cross-validation. And then beyond that, you are done. Its just a fixed function that the neural network computes in one of the layers, and there is actually nothing to learn. It’s just a fixed function.</strong> </p>
<p>So, that’s it for pooling. You now know how to build convolutional layers and pooling layers. In the next video, let’s see a more complex example of a ConvNet. One that will also allow us to introduce fully connected layers.</p>
<h2 id="10-cnn-example"><a href="#10-cnn-example" class="headerlink" title="10_cnn-example"></a>10_cnn-example</h2><p>You now know pretty much all the building blocks of building a full convolutional neural network. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/35.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say you’re inputting an image which is 32 x 32 x 3, so it’s an RGB image and maybe you’re trying to do handwritten digit recognition. So you have a number like 7 in a 32 x 32 RGB initiate trying to recognize which one of the 10 digits from zero to nine is this. Let’s throw the neural network to do this. And what I’m going to use in this slide is inspired, it’s actually quite similar to one of the classic neural networks called LeNet-5, which is created by Yann LeCun many years ago. What I’ll show here isn’t exactly LeNet-5 but it’s inspired by it, but many parameter choices were inspired by it. So with a 32 x 32 x 3 input let’s say that the first layer uses a 5 x 5 filter and a stride of 1, and no padding. So the output of this layer, if you use 6 filters would be 28 x 28 x 6, and we’re going to call this layer conv 1. So you apply 6 filters, add a bias, apply the non-linearity, maybe a real non-linearity, and that’s the conv 1 output. Next, let’s apply a pooling layer, so I am going to apply mass pooling here and let’s use a f=2, s=2. When I don’t write a padding use a pad easy with a 0. Next let’s apply a pooling layer, I am going to apply, let’s see max pooling with a 2 x 2 filter and the stride equals 2. So this is should reduce the height and width of the representation by a factor of 2. So 28 x 28 now becomes 14 x 14, and the number of channels remains the same so 14 x 14 x 6, and we’re going to call this the Pool 1 output. So, it turns out that in the literature of a ConvNet there are two conventions which are inside the inconsistent about what you call a layer. One convention is that this is called one layer. So this will be layer one of the neural network, and now the conversion will be to call they convey layer as a layer and the pool layer as a layer. When people report the number of layers in a neural network usually people just record the number of layers that have weight, that have parameters. <strong>And because the pooling layer has no weights, has no parameters, only a few hyper parameters, I’m going to use a convention that Conv 1 and Pool 1 shared together. I’m going to treat that as Layer 1, although sometimes you see people maybe read articles online and read research papers, you hear about the conv layer and the pooling layer as if they are two separate layers. But this is maybe two slightly inconsistent notation terminologies, but when I count layers, I’m just going to count layers that have weights</strong>. So achieve both of this together as Layer 1. And the name Conv1 and Pool1 use here the 1 at the end also refers the fact that I view both of this is part of Layer 1 of the neural network. And Pool 1 is grouped into Layer 1 because it doesn’t have its own weights. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/36.png" alt=""><br>Next, given a 14 x 14 bx 6 volume, let’s apply another convolutional layer to it, let’s use a filter size that’s 5 x 5, and let’s use a stride of 1, and let’s use 10 filters this time. So now you end up with, A 10 x 10 x 10 volume, so I’ll call this Comv 2, and then in this network let’s do max pulling with f=2, s=2 again. So you could probably guess the output of this, f=2, s=2, this should reduce the height and width by a factor of 2, so you’re left with 5 x 5 x 10. And so I’m going to call this Pool 2, and in our convention this is Layer 2 of the neural network. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/37.png" alt=""><br>Now let’s apply another convolutional layer to this. I’m going to use a 5 x 5 filter, so f = 5, and let’s try this, 1, and I don’t write the padding, means there’s no padding. And this will give you the Conv 2 output, and that’s your 16 filters. So this would be a 10 x 10 x 16 dimensional output. So we look at that, and this is the Conv 2 layer. And then let’s apply max pooling to this with f=2, s=2. You can probably guess the output of this, we’re at 10 x 10 x 16 with max pooling with f=2, s=2. This will half the height and width, you can probably guess the result of this, right? Left pooling with f = 2, s = 2. This should halve the height and width so you end up with a 5 x 5 x 16 volume, same number of channels as before. We’re going to call this Pool 2. And in our convention this is Layer 2 because this has one set of weights and your Conv 2 layer. Now 5 x 5 x 16, 5 x 5 x 16 is equal to 400. So let’s now fatten our Pool 2 into a 400 x 1 dimensional vector. So think of this as fatting this up into these set of neurons, like so. And what we’re going to do is then take these 400 units and let’s build the next layer, As having 120 units. So this is actually our first fully connected layer. I’m going to call this FC3 because we have 400 units densely connected to 120 units. So this fully connected unit, this fully connected layer is just like the single neural network layer that you saw in Courses 1 and 2. This is just a standard neural network where you have a weight matrix that’s called W3 of dimension 120 x 400. And this is fully connected because each of the 400 units here is connected to each of the 120 units here, and you also have the bias parameter, yes that’s going to be just a 120 dimensional, this is 120 outputs. And then lastly let’s take 120 units and add another layer, this time smaller but let’s say we had 84 units here, I’m going to call this fully connected Layer 4. And finally we now have 84 real numbers that you can fit to a [INAUDIBLE] unit. And if you’re trying to do handwritten digital recognition, to recognize this hand it is 0, 1, 2, and so on up to 9. Then this would be a softmax with 10 outputs. So this is a vis-a-vis typical example of what a convolutional neural network might look like. And I know this seems like there a lot of hyper parameters. We’ll give you some more specific suggestions later for how to choose these types of hyper parameters. Maybe one common guideline is to actually not try to invent your own settings of hyper parameters, but to look in the literature to see what hyper parameters you work for others. And to just choose an architecture that has worked well for someone else, and there’s a chance that will work for your application as well. We’ll see more about that next week. But for now I’ll just point out that as you go deeper in the neural network, usually nh and nw to height and width will decrease. Pointed this out earlier, but it goes from 32 x 32, to 20 x 20, to 14 x 14, to 10 x 10, to 5 x 5. <strong>So as you go deeper usually the height and width will decrease, whereas the number of channels will increase</strong>. It’s gone from 3 to 6 to 16, and then your fully connected layer is at the end. <strong>And another pretty common pattern you see in neural networks is to have conv layers, maybe one or more conv layers followed by a pooling layer, and then one or more conv layers followed by pooling layer. And then at the end you have a few fully connected layers and then followed by maybe a softmax. And this is another pretty common pattern you see in neural networks</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/38.png" alt=""><br>So let’s just go through for this neural network some more details of <strong>what are the activation shape, the activation size, and the number of parameters in this network</strong>. So the input was 32 x 30 x 3, and if you multiply out those numbers you should get 3,072. So the activation, a0 has dimension 3072. Well it’s really 32 x 32 x 3. And there are no parameters I guess at the input layer. And as you look at the different layers, feel free to work out the details yourself. These are the activation shape and the activation sizes of these different layers. So just to point out a few things. First, notice that the max pooling layers don’t have any parameters. Second, notice that the conv layers tend to have relatively few parameters, as we discussed in early videos. And in fact, a lot of the parameters tend to be in the fully collected layers of the neural network. And then you notice also that the activation size tends to maybe go down gradually as you go deeper in the neural network. If it drops too quickly, that’s usually not great for performance as well. So it starts first there with 6,000 and 1,600, and then slowly falls into 84 until finally you have your Softmax output. You find that a lot of will have properties will have patterns similar to these. </p>
<p>So you’ve now seen the basic building blocks of neural networks, your convolutional neural networks, the conv layer, the pooling layer, and the fully connected layer. A lot of computer division research has gone into figuring out how to put together these basic building blocks to build effective neural networks. And putting these things together actually requires quite a bit of insight. I think that one of the best ways for you to gain intuition is about how to put these things together is a C a number of concrete examples of how others have done it. So what I want to do next week is show you a few concrete examples even beyond this first one that you just saw on how people have successfully put these things together to build very effective neural networks. And through those videos next week l hope you hold your own intuitions about how these things are built. And as we are given concrete examples that architectures that maybe you can just use here exactly as developed by someone else or your own application. So we’ll do that next week, but before wrapping this week’s videos just one last thing which is one I’ll talk a little bit in the next video about why you might want to use convolutions. Some benefits and advantages of using convolutions as well as how to put them all together. How to take a neural network like the one you just saw and actually train it on a training set to perform image recognition for some of the tasks. So with that let’s go on to the last video of this week.</p>
<h2 id="11-why-convolutions"><a href="#11-why-convolutions" class="headerlink" title="11_why-convolutions"></a>11_why-convolutions</h2><p>For this final video for this week, let’s talk a bit about why convolutions are so useful when you include them in your neural networks. And then finally, let’s briefly talk about how to put this all together and how you could train a convolution neural network when you have a label training set. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/39.png" alt=""><br>I think there are <strong>two main advantages of convolutional layers</strong> over just using fully connected layers. And <strong>the advantages are parameter sharing and sparsity of connections</strong>. Let me illustrate with an example. Let’s say you have a 32 by 32 by 3 dimensional image, and this actually comes from the example from the previous video, but let’s say you use five by five filter with six filters. And so, this gives you a 28 by 28 by 6 dimensional output. So, 32 by 32 by 3 is 3,072, and 28 by 28 by 6 if you multiply all those numbers is 4,704. And so, if you were to create a neural network with 3,072 units in one layer, and with 4,704 units in the next layer, and if you were to connect every one of these neurons, then the weight matrix, the number of parameters in a weight matrix would be 3,072 times 4,704 which is about 14 million. So, that’s just a lot of parameters to train. And today you can train neural networks with even more parameters than 14 million, but considering that this is just a pretty small image, this is a lot of parameters to train. And of course, if this were to be 1,000 by 1,000 image, then your display matrix will just become invisibly large. But if you look at the number of parameters in this convolutional layer, each filter is five by five. So, each filter has 25 parameters, plus a bias parameter miss of 26 parameters per a filter, and you have six filters, so, the total number of parameters is that, which is equal to 156 parameters. And so, the number of parameters in this conv layer remains quite small. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/40.png" alt=""><br><strong>And the reason that a ConvNet has run to these small parameters is really two reasons. One is parameter sharing</strong>. And parameter sharing is motivated by the observation that feature detector such as vertical edge detector, that’s useful in one part of the image is probably useful in another part of the image. And what that means is that, if you’ve figured out say a three by three filter for detecting vertical edges, you can then apply the same three by three filter over here, and then the next position over, and the next position over, and so on. And so, each of these feature detectors, each of these aqua’s can use the same parameters in lots of different positions in your input image in order to detect say a vertical edge or some other feature. And I think this is true for low-level features like edges, as well as the higher level features, like maybe, detecting the eye that indicates a face or a cat or something there. But being with a share in this case the same nine parameters to compute all 16 of these aquas, is one of the ways the number of parameters is reduced. And it also just seems intuitive that a feature detector like a vertical edge detector computes it for the upper left-hand corner of the image. The same feature seems like it will probably be useful, has a good chance of being useful for the lower right-hand corner of the image. So, maybe you don’t need to learn separate feature detectors for the upper left and the lower right-hand corners of the image. And maybe you do have a dataset where you have the upper left-hand corner and lower right-hand corner have different distributions, so, they maybe look a little bit different but they might be similar enough, they’re sharing feature detectors all across the image, works just fine. <strong>The second way that ConvNet get away with having relatively few parameters is by having sparse connections</strong>. So, here’s what I mean, if you look at the zero, this is computed via three by three convolution. And so, it depends only on this three by three inputs grid or cells. So, it is as if this output units on the right is connected only to nine out of these six by six, 36 input features. And in particular, the rest of these pixel values, all of these pixel values do not have any effects on the other output. So, that’s what I mean by sparsity of connections. As another example, this output depends only on these nine input features. And so, it’s as if only those nine input features are connected to this output, and the other pixels just don’t affect this output at all. And so, through these two mechanisms, a neural network has a lot fewer parameters which allows it to be trained with smaller training cells and is less prone to be over 30. And so, sometimes you also hear about convolutional neural networks being very good at capturing <strong>translation invariance</strong>. And that’s the observation that a picture of a cat shifted a couple of pixels to the right, is still pretty clearly a cat. And convolutional structure helps the neural network encode the fact that an image shifted a few pixels should result in pretty similar features and should probably be assigned the same oval label. And the fact that you are applying to same filter, knows all the positions of the image, both in the early layers and in the late layers that helps a neural network automatically learn to be more robust or to better capture the desirable property of translation invariance. So, these are maybe a couple of the reasons why convolutions or convolutional neural network work so well in computer vision. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week1/images/41.png" alt=""><br>Finally, let’s put it all together and see how you can train one of these networks. Let’s say you want to build a cat detector and you have a labeled training sets as follows, where now, X is an image. And the y’s can be binary labels, or one of K causes. And let’s say you’ve chosen a convolutional neural network structure, may be inserted the image and then having neural convolutional and pooling layers and then some fully connected layers followed by a software output that then operates Y hat. <strong>The conv layers and the fully connected layers will have various parameters, W, as well as bias’s B. And so, any setting of the parameters, therefore, lets you define a cost function similar to what we have seen in the previous courses, where we’ve randomly initialized parameters W and B. You can compute the cause J, as the sum of losses of the neural networks predictions on your entire training set, maybe divide it by M. So, to train this neural network, all you need to do is then use gradient descents or some of the algorithm like, gradient descent momentum, or RMSProp or Adam, or something else, in order to optimize all the parameters of the neural network to try to reduce the cost function J</strong>. And you find that if you do this, you can build a very effective cat detector or some other detector. </p>
<p>So, congratulations on finishing this week’s videos. You’ve now seen all the basic building blocks of a convolutional neural network, and how to put them together into an effective image recognition system. <strong>In this week’s program exercises, I think all of these things will come more concrete, and you’ll get the chance to practice implementing these things yourself and seeing it work for yourself. Next week, we’ll continue to go deeper into convolutional neural networks. I mentioned earlier, that there’re just a lot of the hyperparameters in convolution neural networks. So, what I want to do next week, is show you a few concrete examples of some of the most effective convolutional neural networks, so you can start to recognize the patterns of what types of network architectures are effective</strong>. And one thing that people often do is just take the architecture that someone else has found and published in a research paper and just use that for your application. And so, by seeing some more concrete examples next week, you also learn how to do that better. And beyond that, next week, we’ll also just get that intuitions about what makes ConvNet work well, and then in the rest of the course, we’ll also see a variety of other computer vision applications such as, object detection, and neural store transfer. How they create new forms of artwork using these set of algorithms. So, that’s over this week, best of luck with the home works, and I look forward to seeing you next week.</p>

Each function you will implement will have detailed instructions that will walk you through the steps needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convolution functions, including:<ul>
<li>Zero Padding</li>
<li>Convolve window </li>
<li>Convolution forward</li>
<li>Convolution backward (optional)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pooling functions, including:<ul>
<li>Pooling forward</li>
<li>Create mask </li>
<li>Distribute value</li>
<li>Pooling backward (optional)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This notebook will ask you to implement these functions from scratch in <code>numpy</code>. In the next notebook, you will use the TensorFlow equivalents of these functions to build the following model:</p>
<img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/jupter/week1/images/model.png" style="width:800px;height:300px;">

<p><strong>Note</strong> that for every forward function, there is its corresponding backward equivalent. Hence, at every step of your forward module you will store some parameters in a cache. These parameters are used to compute gradients during backpropagation. </p>
<h2 id="3-Convolutional-Neural-Networks"><a href="#3-Convolutional-Neural-Networks" class="headerlink" title="3 - Convolutional Neural Networks"></a>3 - Convolutional Neural Networks</h2><p>Although programming frameworks make convolutions easy to use, they remain one of the hardest concepts to understand in Deep Learning. A convolution layer transforms an input volume into an output volume of different size, as shown below. </p>
<img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/jupter/week1/images/conv_nn.png" style="width:350px;height:200px;">

<p>In this part, you will build every step of the convolution layer. You will first implement two helper functions: one for zero padding and the other for computing the convolution function itself. </p>
<h3 id="3-1-Zero-Padding"><a href="#3-1-Zero-Padding" class="headerlink" title="3.1 - Zero-Padding"></a>3.1 - Zero-Padding</h3><p>Zero-padding adds zeros around the border of an image:</p>
<img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/jupter/week1/images/PAD.png" style="width:600px;height:400px;">
<caption><center> <u> <font color='purple'> **Figure 1** </u><font color='purple'>  : **Zero-Padding**<br> Image (3 channels, RGB) with a padding of 2. </center></caption>

<p>The main benefits of padding are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It allows you to use a CONV layer without necessarily shrinking the height and width of the volumes. This is important for building deeper networks, since otherwise the height/width would shrink as you go to deeper layers. An important special case is the “same” convolution, in which the height/width is exactly preserved after one layer. </p>
</li>
<li><p>It helps us keep more of the information at the border of an image. Without padding, very few values at the next layer would be affected by pixels as the edges of an image.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement the following function, which pads all the images of a batch of examples X with zeros. <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Use np.pad</a>. Note if you want to pad the array “a” of shape $(5,5,5,5,5)$ with <code>pad = 1</code> for the 2nd dimension, <code>pad = 3</code> for the 4th dimension and <code>pad = 0</code> for the rest, you would do:</p>

<p>In a computer vision application, each value in the matrix on the left corresponds to a single pixel value, and we convolve a 3x3 filter with the image by multiplying its values element-wise with the original matrix, then summing them up and adding a bias. In this first step of the exercise, you will implement a single step of convolution, corresponding to applying a filter to just one of the positions to get a single real-valued output. </p>
<p>Later in this notebook, you’ll apply this function to multiple positions of the input to implement the full convolutional operation. </p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement the function below to convolve the filters W on an input activation A_prev. This function takes as input A_prev, the activations output by the previous layer (for a batch of m inputs), F filters/weights denoted by W, and a bias vector denoted by b, where each filter has its own (single) bias. Finally you also have access to the hyperparameters dictionary which contains the stride and the padding. </p>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: </p>
<ol>
<li>To select a 2x2 slice at the upper left corner of a matrix “a_prev” (shape (5,5,3)), you would do:<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">a_slice_prev = a_prev[<span class="number">0</span>:<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">0</span>:<span class="number">2</span>,:]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
This will be useful when you will define <code>a_slice_prev</code> below, using the <code>start/end</code> indexes you will define.</li>
<li>To define a_slice you will need to first define its corners <code>vert_start</code>, <code>vert_end</code>, <code>horiz_start</code> and <code>horiz_end</code>. This figure may be helpful for you to find how each of the corner can be defined using h, w, f and s in the code below.</li>

<p><strong>Reminder</strong>:<br>The formulas relating the output shape of the convolution to the input shape is:<br>$$ n_H = \lfloor \frac{n_{H_{prev}} - f + 2 \times pad}{stride} \rfloor +1 $$<br>$$ n_W = \lfloor \frac{n_{W_{prev}} - f + 2 \times pad}{stride} \rfloor +1 $$<br>$$ n_C = \text{number of filters used in the convolution}$$</p>
<p>For this exercise, we won’t worry about vectorization, and will just implement everything with for-loops.</p>

<p>Finally, CONV layer should also contain an activation, in which case we would add the following line of code:</p>

<h2 id="4-Pooling-layer"><a href="#4-Pooling-layer" class="headerlink" title="4 - Pooling layer"></a>4 - Pooling layer</h2><p>The pooling (POOL) layer reduces the height and width of the input. It helps reduce computation, as well as helps make feature detectors more invariant to its position in the input. The two types of pooling layers are: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Max-pooling layer: slides an ($f, f$) window over the input and stores the max value of the window in the output.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Average-pooling layer: slides an ($f, f$) window over the input and stores the average value of the window in the output.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These pooling layers have no parameters for backpropagation to train. However, they have hyperparameters such as the window size $f$. This specifies the height and width of the fxf window you would compute a max or average over. </p>
<h3 id="4-1-Forward-Pooling"><a href="#4-1-Forward-Pooling" class="headerlink" title="4.1 - Forward Pooling"></a>4.1 - Forward Pooling</h3><p>Now, you are going to implement MAX-POOL and AVG-POOL, in the same function. </p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement the forward pass of the pooling layer. Follow the hints in the comments below.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder</strong>:<br>As there’s no padding, the formulas binding the output shape of the pooling to the input shape is:<br>$$ n_H = \lfloor \frac{n_{H_{prev}} - f}{stride} \rfloor +1 $$<br>$$ n_W = \lfloor \frac{n_{W_{prev}} - f}{stride} \rfloor +1 $$<br>$$ n_C = n_{C_{prev}}$$</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have now implemented the forward passes of all the layers of a convolutional network. </p>
<p>The remainer of this notebook is optional, and will not be graded.</p>
<h2 id="5-Backpropagation-in-convolutional-neural-networks-OPTIONAL-UNGRADED"><a href="#5-Backpropagation-in-convolutional-neural-networks-OPTIONAL-UNGRADED" class="headerlink" title="5 - Backpropagation in convolutional neural networks (OPTIONAL / UNGRADED)"></a>5 - Backpropagation in convolutional neural networks (OPTIONAL / UNGRADED)</h2><p>In modern deep learning frameworks, you only have to implement the forward pass, and the framework takes care of the backward pass, so most deep learning engineers don’t need to bother with the details of the backward pass. The backward pass for convolutional networks is complicated. If you wish however, you can work through this optional portion of the notebook to get a sense of what backprop in a convolutional network looks like. </p>
<p>When in an earlier course you implemented a simple (fully connected) neural network, you used backpropagation to compute the derivatives with respect to the cost to update the parameters. Similarly, in convolutional neural networks you can to calculate the derivatives with respect to the cost in order to update the parameters. The backprop equations are not trivial and we did not derive them in lecture, but we briefly presented them below.</p>
<h3 id="5-1-Convolutional-layer-backward-pass"><a href="#5-1-Convolutional-layer-backward-pass" class="headerlink" title="5.1 - Convolutional layer backward pass"></a>5.1 - Convolutional layer backward pass</h3><p>Let’s start by implementing the backward pass for a CONV layer. </p>
<h4 id="5-1-1-Computing-dA"><a href="#5-1-1-Computing-dA" class="headerlink" title="5.1.1 - Computing dA:"></a>5.1.1 - Computing dA:</h4><p>This is the formula for computing $dA$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$ and a given training example:</p>
<p>$$dA += \sum_{h=0}^{n_H} \sum_{w=0}^{n_W} W_c \times dZ_{hw} \tag{1}$$</p>
<p>Where $W_c$ is a filter and $dZ_{hw}$ is a scalar corresponding to the gradient of the cost with respect to the output of the conv layer Z at the hth row and wth column (corresponding to the dot product taken at the ith stride left and jth stride down). Note that at each time, we multiply the the same filter $W_c$ by a different dZ when updating dA. We do so mainly because when computing the forward propagation, each filter is dotted and summed by a different a_slice. Therefore when computing the backprop for dA, we are just adding the gradients of all the a_slices. </p>
<p>In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">da_prev_pad[vert_start:vert_end, horiz_start:horiz_end, :] += W[:,:,:,c] * dZ[i, h, w, c]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h4 id="5-1-2-Computing-dW"><a href="#5-1-2-Computing-dW" class="headerlink" title="5.1.2 - Computing dW:"></a>5.1.2 - Computing dW:</h4><p>This is the formula for computing $dW_c$ ($dW_c$ is the derivative of one filter) with respect to the loss:</p>
<p>$$ dW_c  += \sum_{h=0}^{n_H} \sum_{w=0}^{n_W} a_{slice} \times dZ_{hw}  \tag{2}$$</p>
<p>Where $a_{slice}$ corresponds to the slice which was used to generate the acitivation $Z_{ij}$. Hence, this ends up giving us the gradient for $W$ with respect to that slice. Since it is the same $W$, we will just add up all such gradients to get $dW$. </p>
<p>In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">dW[:,:,:,c] += a_slice * dZ[i, h, w, c]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h4 id="5-1-3-Computing-db"><a href="#5-1-3-Computing-db" class="headerlink" title="5.1.3 - Computing db:"></a>5.1.3 - Computing db:</h4><p>This is the formula for computing $db$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$:</p>
<p>$$ db = \sum_h \sum_w dZ_{hw} \tag{3}$$</p>
<p>As you have previously seen in basic neural networks, db is computed by summing $dZ$. In this case, you are just summing over all the gradients of the conv output (Z) with respect to the cost. </p>
<p>In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">db[:,:,:,c] += dZ[i, h, w, c]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement the <code>conv_backward</code> function below. You should sum over all the training examples, filters, heights, and widths. You should then compute the derivatives using formulas 1, 2 and 3 above. </p>

<h2 id="5-2-Pooling-layer-backward-pass"><a href="#5-2-Pooling-layer-backward-pass" class="headerlink" title="5.2 Pooling layer - backward pass"></a>5.2 Pooling layer - backward pass</h2><p>Next, let’s implement the backward pass for the pooling layer, starting with the MAX-POOL layer. Even though a pooling layer has no parameters for backprop to update, you still need to backpropagation the gradient through the pooling layer in order to compute gradients for layers that came before the pooling layer. </p>
<h3 id="5-2-1-Max-pooling-backward-pass"><a href="#5-2-1-Max-pooling-backward-pass" class="headerlink" title="5.2.1 Max pooling - backward pass"></a>5.2.1 Max pooling - backward pass</h3><p>Before jumping into the backpropagation of the pooling layer, you are going to build a helper function called <code>create_mask_from_window()</code> which does the following: </p>
<p>$$ X = \begin{bmatrix}<br>1 &amp;&amp; 3 \<br>4 &amp;&amp; 2<br>\end{bmatrix} \quad \rightarrow  \quad M =\begin{bmatrix}<br>0 &amp;&amp; 0 \<br>1 &amp;&amp; 0<br>\end{bmatrix}\tag{4}$$</p>
<p>As you can see, this function creates a “mask” matrix which keeps track of where the maximum of the matrix is. True (1) indicates the position of the maximum in X, the other entries are False (0). You’ll see later that the backward pass for average pooling will be similar to this but using a different mask.  </p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement <code>create_mask_from_window()</code>. This function will be helpful for pooling backward.<br>Hints:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="">np.max()</a> may be helpful. It computes the maximum of an array.</li>
<li>If you have a matrix X and a scalar x: <code>A = (X == x)</code> will return a matrix A of the same size as X such that:<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">A[i,j] &#x3D; True if X[i,j] &#x3D; x</span><br><span class="line">A[i,j] &#x3D; False if X[i,j] !&#x3D; x</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li>

<p>Why do we keep track of the position of the max? It’s because this is the input value that ultimately influenced the output, and therefore the cost. Backprop is computing gradients with respect to the cost, so anything that influences the ultimate cost should have a non-zero gradient. So, backprop will “propagate” the gradient back to this particular input value that had influenced the cost. </p>
<h3 id="5-2-2-Average-pooling-backward-pass"><a href="#5-2-2-Average-pooling-backward-pass" class="headerlink" title="5.2.2 - Average pooling - backward pass"></a>5.2.2 - Average pooling - backward pass</h3><p>In max pooling, for each input window, all the “influence” on the output came from a single input value–the max. In average pooling, every element of the input window has equal influence on the output. So to implement backprop, you will now implement a helper function that reflects this.</p>
<p>For example if we did average pooling in the forward pass using a 2x2 filter, then the mask you’ll use for the backward pass will look like:<br>$$ dZ = 1 \quad \rightarrow  \quad dZ =\begin{bmatrix}<br>1/4 &amp;&amp; 1/4 \<br>1/4 &amp;&amp; 1/4<br>\end{bmatrix}\tag{5}$$</p>
<p>This implies that each position in the $dZ$ matrix contributes equally to output because in the forward pass, we took an average. </p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement the function below to equally distribute a value dz through a matrix of dimension shape. <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hint</a></p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement the <code>pool_backward</code> function in both modes (<code>&quot;max&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;average&quot;</code>). You will once again use 4 for-loops (iterating over training examples, height, width, and channels). You should use an <code>if/elif</code> statement to see if the mode is equal to <code>&#39;max&#39;</code> or <code>&#39;average&#39;</code>. If it is equal to ‘average’ you should use the <code>distribute_value()</code> function you implemented above to create a matrix of the same shape as <code>a_slice</code>. Otherwise, the mode is equal to ‘<code>max</code>‘, and you will create a mask with <code>create_mask_from_window()</code> and multiply it by the corresponding value of dZ.</p>

If you’re trying to get a learning algorithm to do a task that humans can do. And if your learning algorithm is not yet at the performance of a human. Then manually examining mistakes that your algorithm is making, can give you insights into what to do next. This process is called error analysis. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/1.png" alt=""><br>Let’s start with an example. Let’s say you’re working on your cat classifier, and you’ve achieved 90% accuracy, or equivalently 10% error, on your dev set. And let’s say this is much worse than you’re hoping to do. Maybe one of your teammates looks at some of the examples that the algorithm is misclassifying, and <strong>notices that it is miscategorizing some dogs as cats</strong>. And if you look at these two dogs, maybe they look a little bit like a cat, at least at first glance. <strong>So maybe your teammate comes to you with a proposal for how to make the algorithm do better, specifically on dogs, right? You can imagine building a focus effort, maybe to collect more dog pictures, or maybe to design features specific to dogs, or something</strong>. In order to make your cat classifier do better on dogs, so it stops misrecognizing these dogs as cats. <strong>So the question is, should you go ahead and start a project focus on the dog problem? There could be several months of works you could do in order to make your algorithm make few mistakes on dog pictures. So is that worth your effort?</strong> Well, rather than spending a few months doing this, <strong>only to risk finding out at the end that it wasn’t that helpful</strong>. </p>
<p>Here’s an error analysis procedure that can let you very quickly tell whether or not this could be worth your effort. <strong>Here’s what I recommend you do. First</strong>, get about, say 100 mislabeled dev set examples, then examine them manually. Just count them up one at a time, to see how many of these mislabeled examples in your dev set are actually pictures of dogs. Now, suppose that it turns out that 5% of your 100 mislabeled dev set examples are pictures of dogs. So, that is, if 5 out of 100 of these mislabeled dev set examples are dogs, what this means is that of the 100 examples. Of a typical set of 100 examples you’re getting wrong, even if you completely solve the dog problem, you only get 5 out of 100 more correct. Or in other words, <strong>if only 5% of your errors are dog pictures, then the best you could easily hope to do, if you spend a lot of time on the dog problem. Is that your error might go down from 10% error, down to 9.5% error, right? So this a 5% relative decrease in error, from 10% down to 9.5%. And so you might reasonably decide that this is not the best use of your time.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Or maybe it is, but at least this gives you a ceiling, right? Upper bound on how much you could improve performance by working on the dog problem, right</strong>? In machine learning, sometimes we call this <strong>the ceiling on performance</strong>. Which just means, what’s in the best case? How well could working on the dog problem help you? </p>
<p>But now, suppose something else happens. <strong>Suppose that we look at your 100 mislabeled dev set examples, you find that 50 of them are actually dog images. So 50% of them are dog pictures. Now you could be much more optimistic about spending time on the dog problem. In this case, if you actually solve the dog problem, your error would go down from this 10%, down to potentially 5% error. And you might decide that halving your error could be worth a lot of effort. Focus on reducing the problem of mislabeled dogs.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>I know that in machine learning, sometimes we speak disparagingly of hand engineering things, or using too much value insight. But if you’re building applied systems, then this simple counting procedure, error analysis, can save you a lot of time. In terms of deciding what’s the most important, or what’s the most promising direction to focus on</strong>. In fact, if you’re looking at 100 mislabeled dev set examples, maybe this is a 5 to 10 minute effort. To manually go through 100 examples, and manually count up how many of them are dogs. And depending on the outcome, whether there’s more like 5%, or 50%, or something else. This, in just 5 to 10 minutes, gives you an estimate of how worthwhile this direction is. And could help you make a much better decision, whether or not to spend the next few months focused on trying to find solutions to solve the problem of mislabeled dogs. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/2.png" alt=""><br>In this slide, we’ll describe using error analysis to evaluate whether or not a single idea, dogs in this case, is worth working on. <strong>Sometimes you can also evaluate multiple ideas in parallel doing error analysis</strong>. For example, let’s say you have several ideas in improving your cat detector. Maybe you can improve performance on dogs? Or maybe you notice that sometimes, what are called great cats, such as lions, panthers, cheetahs, and so on. That they are being recognized as small cats, or house cats. So you could maybe find a way to work on that. Or maybe you find that some of your images are blurry, and it would be nice if you could design something that just works better on blurry images. And maybe you have some ideas on how to do that. So if carrying out error analysis to evaluate these three ideas, what I would do is create a table like this. And I usually do this in a spreadsheet, but using an ordinary text file will also be okay. And on the left side, this goes through the set of images you plan to look at manually. So this maybe goes from 1 to 100, if you look at 100 pictures. And the columns of this table, of the spreadsheet, will correspond to the ideas you’re evaluating. So the dog problem, the problem of great cats, and blurry images. And I usually also leave space in the spreadsheet to write comments. So remember, during error analysis, you’re just looking at dev set examples that your algorithm has misrecognized. So if you find that the first misrecognized image is a picture of a dog, then I’d put a check mark there. And to help myself remember these images, sometimes I’ll make a note in the comments. So maybe that was a pit bull picture. If the second picture was blurry, then make a note there. If the third one was a lion, on a rainy day, in the zoo that was misrecognized. Then that’s a great cat, and the blurry data. Make a note in the comment section, rainy day at zoo, and it was the rain that made it blurry, and so on. Then finally, having gone through some set of images, I would count up what percentage of these algorithms. Or what percentage of each of these error categories were attributed to the dog, or great cat, blurry categories. So maybe 8% of these images you examine turn out be dogs, and maybe 43% great cats, and 61% were blurry. So this just means going down each column, and counting up what percentage of images have a check mark in that column. As you’re part way through this process, sometimes you notice other categories of mistakes. So, for example, you might find that Instagram style filter, those fancy image filters, are also messing up your classifier. In that case, it’s actually okay, part way through the process, to add another column like that. For the multi-colored filters, the Instagram filters, and the Snapchat filters. And then go through and count up those as well, and figure out what percentage comes from that new error category. The conclusion of this process gives you an estimate of how worthwhile it might be to work on each of these different categories of errors. For example, clearly in this example, a lot of the mistakes we made on blurry images, and quite a lot on were made on great cat images. <strong>And so the outcome of this analysis is not that you must work on blurry images. This doesn’t give you a rigid mathematical formula that tells you what to do, but it gives you a sense of the best options to pursue</strong>. It also tells you, for example, that no matter how much better you do on dog images, or on Instagram images. You at most improve performance by maybe 8%, or 12%, in these examples. Whereas you can to better on great cat images, or blurry images, the potential improvement. Now there’s a ceiling in terms of how much you could improve performance, is much higher. So depending on how many ideas you have for improving performance on great cats, on blurry images. Maybe you could pick one of the two, or if you have enough personnel on your team, maybe you can have two different teams. Have one work on improving errors on great cats, and a different team work on improving errors on blurry images. <strong>But this quick counting procedure, which you can often do in, at most, small numbers of hours. Can really help you make much better prioritization decisions, and understand how promising different approaches are to work on</strong>. </p>
<p>So to summarize, to carry out error analysis, you should find a set of mislabeled examples, either in your dev set, or in your development set. And look at the mislabeled examples for false positives and false negatives. And just count up the number of errors that fall into various different categories. During this process, you might be inspired to generate new categories of errors, like we saw. If you’re looking through the examples and you say gee, there are a lot of Instagram filters, or Snapchat filters, they’re also messing up my classifier. You can create new categories during that process. But by counting up the fraction of examples that are mislabeled in different ways, often this will help you prioritize. Or give you inspiration for new directions to go in. Now as you’re doing error analysis, sometimes you notice that some of your examples in your dev sets are mislabeled. So what do you do about that? Let’s discuss that in the next video. </p>
<h3 id="02-cleaning-up-incorrectly-labeled-data"><a href="#02-cleaning-up-incorrectly-labeled-data" class="headerlink" title="02_cleaning-up-incorrectly-labeled-data"></a>02_cleaning-up-incorrectly-labeled-data</h3><p>The data for your supervised learning problem comprises input X and output labels Y. What if you going through your data and you find that some of these output labels Y are incorrect, you have data which is incorrectly labeled? Is it worth your while to go in to fix up some of these labels? Let’s take a look. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/3.png" alt=""><br>In the cat classification problem, Y equals one for cats and zero for non-cats. So, let’s say you’re looking through some data and that’s a cat, that’s not a cat, that’s a cat, that’s a cat, that’s not a cat, that’s at a cat. No, wait. That’s actually not a cat. So this is an example with an incorrect label. So I’ve used the term, mislabeled examples, to refer to if your learning algorithm outputs the wrong value of Y. But I’m going to say, incorrectly labeled examples, to refer to if in the data set you have in the training set or the dev set or the test set, the label for Y, whatever a human label assigned to this piece of data, is actually incorrect. And that’s actually a dog so that Y really should have been zero. But maybe the labeler got that one wrong. So if you find that your data has some incorrectly labeled examples, what should you do? Well, first, let’s consider the training set. <strong>It turns out that deep learning algorithms are quite robust to random errors in the training set. So long as your errors or your incorrectly labeled examples, so long as those errors are not too far from random, maybe sometimes the labeler just wasn’t paying attention or they accidentally, randomly hit the wrong key on the keyboard. If the errors are reasonably random, then it’s probably okay to just leave the errors as they are and not spend too much time fixing them. There’s certainly no harm to going into your training set and be examining the labels and fixing them. Sometimes that is worth doing but your effort might be okay even if you don’t. So long as the total data set size is big enough and the actual percentage of errors is maybe not too high</strong>. So I see a lot of machine learning algorithms that trained even when we know that there are few X mistakes in the training set labels and usually works okay. <strong>There is one caveat to this which is that deep learning algorithms are robust to random errors. They are less robust to systematic errors. So for example, if your labeler consistently labels white dogs as cats, then that is a problem because your classifier will learn to classify all white colored dogs as cats. But random errors or near random errors are usually not too bad for most deep learning algorithms</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/4.png" alt=""><br><strong>Now, this discussion has focused on what to do about incorrectly labeled examples in your training set. How about incorrectly labeled examples in your dev set or test set? If you’re worried about the impact of incorrectly labeled examples on your dev set or test set, what they recommend you do is during error analysis to add one extra column so that you can also count up the number of examples where the label Y was incorrect</strong>. So for example, maybe when you count up the impact on a 100 mislabeled dev set examples, so you’re going to find a 100 examples where your classifier’s output disagrees with the label in your dev set. And sometimes for a few of those examples, your classifier disagrees with the label because the label was wrong, rather than because your classifier was wrong. So maybe in this example, you find that the labeler missed a cat in the background. So put the check mark there to signify that example 98 had an incorrect label. And maybe for this one, the picture is actually a picture of a drawing of a cat rather than a real cat. Maybe you want the labeler to have labeled that Y equals zero rather than Y equals one. And so put another check mark there. <strong>And just as you count up the percent of errors due to other categories like we saw in the previous video, you’d also count up the fraction of percentage of errors due to incorrect labels. Where the Y value in your dev set was wrong and that accounted for why your learning algorithm made a prediction that differed from what the label on your data says</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/5.png" alt=""><br>So the question now is, is it worthwhile going in to try to fix up this 6% of incorrectly labeled examples. <strong>My advice is, if it makes a significant difference to your ability to evaluate algorithms on your dev set, then go ahead and spend the time to fix incorrect labels. But if it doesn’t make a significant difference to your ability to use the dev set to evaluate cost buyers, then it might not be the best use of your time</strong>. Let me show you an example that illustrates what I mean by this. So, three numbers I recommend you look at to try to decide if it’s worth going in and reducing the number of mislabeled examples are the following. I recommend you look at the overall dev set error. And so in the example we had from the previous video, we said that maybe our system has 90% overall accuracy. So 10% error. Then you should look at the number of errors or the percentage of errors that are due to incorrect labels. So it looks like in this case, 6% of the errors are due to incorrect labels. So 6% of 10% is 0.6%. And then you should look at errors due to all other causes. So if you made 10% error on your dev set and 0.6% of those are because the labels is wrong, then the remainder, 9.4% of them, are due to other causes such as misrecognizing dogs being cats, great cats and their images. So in this case, I would say there’s 9.4% worth of error that you could focus on fixing, whereas the errors due to incorrect labels is a relatively small fraction of the overall set of errors. So by all means, go in and fix these incorrect labels if you want but it’s maybe not the most important thing to do right now. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/6.png" alt=""><br>Now, let’s take another example. Suppose you’ve made a lot more progress on your learning problem. So instead of 10% error, let’s say you brought the errors down to 2%, but still 0.6% of your overall errors are due to incorrect labels. So now, if you want to examine a set of mislabeled dev set images, set that comes from just 2% of dev set data you’re mislabeling, then a very large fraction of them, 0.6 divided by 2%, so that is actually 30% rather than 6% of your labels. Your incorrect examples are actually due to incorrectly label examples. And so errors due to other causes are now 1.4%. When such a high fraction of your mistakes as measured on your dev set due to incorrect labels, then it maybe seems much more worthwhile to fix up the incorrect labels in your dev set. And if you remember the goal of the dev set, the main purpose of the dev set is, you want to really use it to help you select between two classifiers A and B. So you’re trying out two classifiers A and B, and one has 2.1% error and the other has 1.9% error on your dev set. But you don’t trust your dev set anymore to be correctly telling you whether this classifier is actually better than this because your 0.6% of these mistakes are due to incorrect labels. Then there’s a good reason to go in and fix the incorrect labels in your dev set. Because in this example on the right is just having a very large impact on the overall assessment of the errors of the algorithm, whereas example on the left, the percentage impact is having on your algorithm is still smaller. </p>
<p>Now, if you decide to go into a dev set and manually re-examine the labels and try to fix up some of the labels, <strong>here are a few additional guidelines or principles to consider.</strong> <strong>First</strong>, <strong>I would encourage you to apply whatever process you apply to both your dev and test sets at the same time.</strong> We’ve talk previously about why you want to dev and test sets to come from the same distribution. The dev set is tagging you into target and when you hit it, you want that to generalize to the test set. So your team really works more efficiently to dev and test sets come from the same distribution. So if you’re going in to fix something on the dev set, I would apply the same process to the test set to make sure that they continue to come from the same distribution. So we hire someone to examine the labels more carefully. Do that for both your dev and test sets. <strong>Second, I would urge you to consider examining examples your algorithm got right as well as ones it got wrong</strong>. It is easy to look at the examples your algorithm got wrong and just see if any of those need to be fixed. <strong>But it’s possible that there are some examples that you haven’t got right, that should also be fixed. And if you only fix ones that your algorithms got wrong, you end up with more bias estimates of the error of your algorithm. It gives your algorithm a little bit of an unfair advantage</strong>. We just try to double check what it got wrong but you don’t also double check what it got right because it might have gotten something right, that it was just lucky on fixing the label would cause it to go from being right to being wrong, on that example. <strong>The second bullet isn’t always easy to do, so it’s not always done. The reason it’s not always done is because if you classifier’s very accurate, then it’s getting fewer things wrong than right.</strong> So if your classifier has 98% accuracy, then it’s getting 2% of things wrong and 98% of things right. So it’s much easier to examine and validate the labels on 2% of the data and it takes much longer to validate labels on 98% of the data, so this isn’t always done. That’s just something to consider. <strong>Finally, if you go into a dev and test data to correct some of the labels there, you may or may not decide to go and apply the same process for the training set. Remember we said that at this other video that it’s actually less important to correct the labels in your training set. And it’s quite possible you decide to just correct the labels in your dev and test set which are also often smaller than a training set and you might not invest all that extra effort needed to correct the labels in a much larger training set.</strong> This is actually okay. We’ll talk later this week about some processes for handling when your training data is different in distribution than you dev and test data. Learning algorithms are quite robust to that. <strong>It’s super important that your dev and test sets come from the same distribution. But if your training set comes from a slightly different distribution, often that’s a pretty reasonable thing to do. I will talk more about how to handle this later this week.</strong> </p>
<p>So I’d like to wrap up with just a couple of pieces of advice. <strong>First</strong>, deep learning researchers sometimes like to say things like, “I just fed the data to the algorithm. I trained in and it worked.” There is a lot of truth to that in the deep learning error. There is more of feeding data in algorithm and just training it and doing less hand engineering and using less human insight. But <strong>I think that in building practical systems, often there’s also more manual error analysis and more human insight that goes into the systems than sometimes deep learning researchers like to acknowledge</strong>. </p>
<p>Second is that somehow I’ve seen some engineers and researchers be reluctant to manually look at the examples. Maybe it’s not the most interesting thing to do, to sit down and look at a 100 or a couple hundred examples to counter the number of errors. But this is something that I so do myself. <strong>When I’m leading a machine learning team and I want to understand what mistakes it is making, I would actually go in and look at the data myself and try to counter the fraction of errors. And I think that because these minutes or maybe a small number of hours of counting data can really help you prioritize where to go next. I find this a very good use of your time and I urge you to consider doing it if those machines are in your system and you’re trying to decide what ideas or what directions to prioritize things. So that’s it for the error analysis process.</strong> In the next video, I want to share a view of some thoughts on how error analysis fits in to how you might go about starting out on the new machine learning project.</p>
<h3 id="03-build-your-first-system-quickly-then-iterate"><a href="#03-build-your-first-system-quickly-then-iterate" class="headerlink" title="03_build-your-first-system-quickly-then-iterate"></a>03_build-your-first-system-quickly-then-iterate</h3><p><strong>If you’re working on a brand new machine learning application, one of the piece of advice I often give people is that, I think you should build your first system quickly and then iterate</strong>. Let me show you what I mean. </p>
<p>I’ve worked on speech recognition for many years. <strong>And if you’re thinking of building a new speech recognition system, there’s actually a lot of directions you could go and a lot of things you could prioritize.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/7.png" alt=""><br>For example, there are specific techniques for making speech recognition systems more robust to noisy background. And noisy background could mean cafe noise, like a lot of people talking in the background or car noise, the sounds of cars and highways or other types of noise. There are ways to make a speech recognition system more robust to accented speech. There are specific problems associated with speakers that are far from the microphone, this is called far-field speech recognition. Young children speech poses special challenges, both in terms of how they pronounce individual words as well as their choice of words and the vocabulary they tend to use. And if sometimes the speaker stutters or if they use nonsensical phrases like oh, ah, um, there are different choices and different techniques for making the transcript that you output, still read more fluently. So, there are these and many other things you could do to improve a speech recognition system. <strong>And more generally, for almost any machine learning application, there could be 50 different directions you could go in and each of these directions is reasonable and would make your system better. But the challenge is, how do you pick which of these to focus on.</strong> And even though I’ve worked in speech recognition for many years, if I’m building a new system for a new application domain, I would still find it maybe a little bit difficult to pick without spending some time thinking about the problem. So what we recommend you do, if you’re starting on building a brand new machine learning application, is to build your first system quickly and then iterate. What I mean by that is I recommend that you first quickly set up a dev/test set and metric. So this is really deciding where to place your target. And if you get it wrong, you can always move it later, but just set up a target somewhere. And then I recommend you build an initial machine learning system quickly. Find the training set, train it and see. Start to see and understand how well you’re doing against your dev/test set and your values and metric. When you build your initial system, you then be able to use bias/variance analysis which we talked about earlier as well as error analysis which we talked about just in the last several videos, to prioritize the next steps. In particular, if error analysis causes you to realize that a lot of the errors are from the speaker being very far from the microphone, which causes special challenges to speech recognition, then that will give you a good reason to focus on techniques to address this called far-field speech recognition which basically means handling when the speaker is very far from the microphone. <strong>Of all the value of building this initial system, it can be a quick and dirty implementation, you know, don’t overthink it, but all the value of the initial system is having some learned system, having some trained system allows you to localize bias/variance, to try to prioritize what to do next, allows you to do error analysis, look at some mistakes, to figure out all the different directions you can go in, which ones are actually the most worthwhile.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>So to recap, what I recommend you do is build your first system quickly, then iterate. This advice applies less strongly if you’re working on an application area in which you have significant prior experience. It also applies to build less strongly if there’s a significant body of academic literature that you can draw on for pretty much the exact same problem you’re building.</strong> So, for example, there’s a large academic literature on face recognition. And if you’re trying to build a face recognizer, it might be okay to build a more complex system from the get-go by building on this large body of academic literature. But if you are tackling a new problem for the first time, then I would encourage you to really not overthink or not make your first system too complicated. Well, just build something quick and dirty and then use that to help you prioritize how to improve your system. </p>
<p>So I’ve seen a lot of machine learning projects and I’ve seen some teams overthink the solution and build something too complicated. I’ve also seen some teams underthink and then build something maybe too simple. Well on average, I’ve seen a lot more teams overthink and build something too complicated. And I’ve seen teams build something too simple. So I hope this helps, and if you are applying to your machine learning algorithms to a new application, and <strong>if your main goal is to build something that works, as opposed to if your main goal is to invent a new machine learning algorithm which is a different goal, then your main goal is to get something that works really well. I’d encourage you to build something quick and dirty. Use that to do bias/variance analysis, use that to do error analysis and use the results of those analysis to help you prioritize where to go next</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="02-mismatched-training-and-dev-test-set"><a href="#02-mismatched-training-and-dev-test-set" class="headerlink" title="02_mismatched-training-and-dev-test-set"></a>02_mismatched-training-and-dev-test-set</h2><h3 id="01-training-and-testing-on-different-distributions"><a href="#01-training-and-testing-on-different-distributions" class="headerlink" title="01_training-and-testing-on-different-distributions"></a>01_training-and-testing-on-different-distributions</h3><p>Deep learning algorithms have a huge hunger for training data. They just often work best when you can find enough label training data to put into the training set. This has resulted in many teams sometimes taking whatever data you can find and just shoving it into the training set just to get it more training data. Even if some of this data, or even maybe a lot of this data, doesn’t come from the same distribution as your dev and test data. So in a deep learning era, more and more teams are now training on data that comes from a different distribution than your dev and test sets. And there’s some subtleties and some best practices for dealing with when you’re training and test distributions differ from each other. Let’s take a look. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/8.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say that you’re building a mobile app where users will upload pictures taken from their cell phones, and you want to recognize whether the pictures that your users upload from the mobile app is a cat or not. <strong>So you can now get two sources of data. One which is the distribution of data you really care about, this data from a mobile app like that on the right, which tends to be less professionally shot, less well framed, maybe even blurrier because it’s shot by amateur users. The other source of data you can get is you can crawl the web and just download a lot of, for the sake of this example, let’s say you can download a lot of very professionally framed, high resolution, professionally taken images of cats</strong>. And let’s say you don’t have a lot of users yet for your mobile app. So maybe you’ve gotten 10,000 pictures uploaded from the mobile app. But by crawling the web you can download huge numbers of cat pictures, and maybe you have 200,000 pictures of cats downloaded off the Internet. So what you really care about is that your final system does well on the mobile app distribution of images, right? Because in the end, your users will be uploading pictures like those on the right and you need your classifier to do well on that. But you now have a bit of a dilemma because you have a relatively small dataset, just 10,000 examples drawn from that distribution. And you have a much bigger dataset that’s drawn from a different distribution. There’s a different appearance of image than the one you actually want. <strong>So you don’t want to use just those 10,000 images because it ends up giving you a relatively small training set. And using those 200,000 images seems helpful, but the dilemma is this 200,000 images isn’t from exactly the distribution you want</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So what can you do? Well, here’s one option. One thing you can do is put both of these data sets together so you now have 210,000 images. <strong>And you can then take the 210,000 images and randomly shuffle them into a train, dev, and test set. And let’s say for the sake of argument that you’ve decided that your dev and test sets will be 2,500 examples each</strong>. So your training set will be 205,000 examples. Now so set up your data this way has some advantages but also disadvantages. <strong>The advantage is that now you’re training, dev and test sets will all come from the same distribution, so that makes it easier to manage. But the disadvantage, and this is a huge disadvantage, is that if you look at your dev set, of these 2,500 examples, a lot of it will come from the web page distribution of images, rather than what you actually care about, which is the mobile app distribution of images.</strong> So it turns out that of your total amount of data, 200,000, so I’ll just abbreviate that 200k, out of 210,000, we’ll write that as 210k, that comes from web pages. So all of these 2,500 examples on expectation, I think 2,381 of them will come from web pages. This is on expectation, the exact number will vary around depending on how the random shuttle operation went. But on average, only 119 will come from mobile app uploads. So remember that setting up your dev set is telling your team where to aim the target. And the way you’re aiming your target, you’re saying spend most of the time optimizing for the web page distribution of images, which is really not what you want. So I would recommend against option one, because this is setting up the dev set to tell your team to optimize for a different distribution of data than what you actually care about. <strong>So instead of doing this, I would recommend that you instead take another option, which is the following. The training set, let’s say it’s still 205,000 images, I would have the training set have all 200,000 images from the web.</strong> And then you can, if you want, add in 5,000 images from the mobile app. And then for your dev and test sets, I guess my data sets size aren’t drawn to scale. <strong>Your dev and test sets would be all mobile app images. So the training set will include 200,000 images from the web and 5,000 from the mobile app. The dev set will be 2,500 images from the mobile app, and the test set will be 2,500 images also from the mobile app. The advantage of this way of splitting up your data into train, dev, and test, is that you’re now aiming the target where you want it to be.</strong> You’re telling your team, my dev set has data uploaded from the mobile app and that’s the distribution of images you really care about, so let’s try to build a machine learning system that does really well on the mobile app distribution of images. The disadvantage, of course, is that now your training distribution is different from your dev and test set distributions. But it turns out that this split of your data into train, dev and test will get you better performance over the long term. And we’ll discuss later some specific techniques for dealing with your training sets coming from different distribution than your dev and test sets. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/10.png" alt=""><br>Let’s look at another example. Let’s say you’re building a brand new product, <strong>a speech activated rearview mirror for a car</strong>. So this is a real product in China. It’s making its way into other countries but you can build a rearview mirror to replace this little thing there, so that you can now talk to the rearview mirror and basically say, dear rearview mirror, please help me find navigational directions to the nearest gas station and it’ll deal with it. So this is actually a real product, and let’s say you’re trying to build this for your own country. So how can you get data to train up a speech recognition system for this product? Well, maybe you’ve worked on speech recognition for a long time so you have a lot of data from other speech recognition applications, just not from a speech activated rearview mirror. Here’s how you could split up your training and your dev and test sets. So for your training, you can take all the speech data you have that you’ve accumulated from working on other speech problems, such as data you purchased over the years from various speech recognition data vendors. And today you can actually buy data from vendors of x, y pairs, where x is an audio clip and y is a transcript. Or maybe you’ve worked on smart speakers, smart voice activated speakers, so you have some data from that. Maybe you’ve worked on voice activated keyboards and so on. And for the sake of argument, maybe you have 500,000 utterences from all of these sources. And for your dev and test set, maybe you have a much smaller data set that actually came from a speech activated rearview mirror. Because users are asking for navigational queries or trying to find directions to various places. This data set will maybe have a lot more street addresses, right? Please help me navigate to this street address, or please help me navigate to this gas station. So this distribution of data will be very different than these on the left. But this is really the data you care about, because this is what you need your product to do well on, so this is what you set your dev and test set to be. So what you do in this example is set your training set to be the 500,000 utterances on the left, and then your dev and test sets which I’ll abbreviate D and T, these could be maybe 10,000 utterances each. That’s drawn from actual the speech activated rearview mirror. Or alternatively, if you think you don’t need to put all 20,000 examples from your speech activated rearview mirror into the dev and test sets, maybe you can take half of that and put that in the training set. So then the training set could be 510,000 utterances, including all 500 from there and 10,000 from the rearview mirror. And then the dev and test sets could maybe be 5,000 utterances each. So of the 20,000 utterances, maybe 10k goes into the training set and 5k into the dev set and 5,000 into the test set. So this would be another reasonable way of splitting your data into train, dev, and test. And this gives you a much bigger training set, over 500,000 utterances, than if you were to only use speech activated rearview mirror data for your training set. </p>
<p>So in this video, you’ve seen a couple examples of when allowing your training set data to come from a different distribution than your dev and test set allows you to have much more training data. And in these examples, it will cause your learning algorithm to perform better. <strong>Now one question you might ask is, should you always use all the data you have? The answer is subtle, it is not always yes. Let’s look at a counter-example in the next video</strong>. </p>
<h3 id="02-bias-and-variance-with-mismatched-data-distributions"><a href="#02-bias-and-variance-with-mismatched-data-distributions" class="headerlink" title="02_bias-and-variance-with-mismatched-data-distributions"></a>02_bias-and-variance-with-mismatched-data-distributions</h3><p>Estimating the bias and variance of your learning algorithm really helps you prioritize what to work on next. But <strong>the way you analyze bias and variance changes when your training set comes from a different distribution than your dev and test sets.</strong> Let’s see how. </p>
<p>Let’s keep using our cat classification example and let’s say humans get near perfect performance on this. So, Bayes error, or <strong>Bayes optimal error, we know is nearly 0% on this problem</strong>. So, to carry out error analysis you usually look at the training error and also look at the error on the dev set. So let’s say, in this example that your <strong>training error is 1%</strong>, and <strong>your dev error is 10%</strong>. If your dev data came from the same distribution as your training set, you would say that here you have a large variance problem, that your algorithm’s just not generalizing well from the training set which it’s doing well on to the dev set, which it’s suddenly doing much worse on. But in the setting where your training data and your dev data comes from a different distribution, you can no longer safely draw this conclusion. In particular, maybe it’s doing just fine on the dev set, it’s just that the training set was really easy because it was high res, very clear images, and maybe the dev set is just much harder. So maybe there isn’t a variance problem and this just reflects that the dev set contains images that are much more difficult to classify accurately. <strong>So the problem with this analysis is that when you went from the training error to the dev error, two things changed at a time. One is that the algorithm saw data in the training set but not in the dev set. Two, the distribution of data in the dev set is different. And because you changed two things at the same time, it’s difficult to know of this 9% increase in error, how much of it is because the algorithm didn’t see the data in the dev set, so that’s some of the variance part of the problem. And how much of it, is because the dev set data is just different.</strong> So, in order to tease out these two effects, and if you didn’t totally follow what these two different effects are, don’t worry, we will go over it again in a second. But in order to tease out these two effects it will be useful to define a new piece of data which we’ll call the <strong>training-dev set</strong>. So, <strong>this is a new subset of data, which we carve out that should have the same distribution as training sets, but you don’t explicitly train in your network on this</strong>. So here’s what I mean. Previously we had set up some training sets and some dev sets and some test sets as follows. <strong>And the dev and test sets have the same distribution, but the training sets will have some different distribution. What we’re going to do is randomly shuffle the training sets and then carve out just a piece of the training set to be the training-dev set. So just as the dev and test set have the same distribution, the training set and the training-dev set, also have the same distribution</strong>. But, the difference is that now you train your neural network, just on the training set proper. <strong>You won’t let the neural network, you won’t run that obligation on the training-dev portion of this data. To carry out error analysis, what you should do is now look at the error of your classifier on the training set, on the training-dev set, as well as on the dev set</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/11.png" alt=""><br>So let’s say in this example that your <strong>training error is 1%</strong>. And let’s say <strong>the error on the training-dev set is 9%</strong>, and <strong>the error on the dev set is 10%</strong>, same as before. What you can conclude from this is that when you went from training data to training dev data the error really went up a lot. And only the difference between the training data and the training-dev data is that your neural network got to sort the first part of this. It was trained explicitly on this, but it wasn’t trained explicitly on the training-dev data. So this tells you that you have a variance problem. Because the training-dev error was measured on data that comes from the same distribution as your training set. <strong>So you know that even though your neural network does well in a training set, it’s just not generalizing well to data in the training-dev set which comes from the same distribution, but it’s just not generalizing well to data from the same distribution that it hadn’t seen before. So in this example we have really a variance problem</strong>. </p>
<p>Let’s look at a different example. Let’s say <strong>the training error is 1%</strong>, and <strong>the training-dev error is 1.5%</strong>, but when you go to <strong>the dev set your error is 10%</strong>. So now, you have actually a pretty low variance problem, because when you went from training data that you’ve seen to the training-dev data that the neural network has not seen, the error increases only a little bit, but then it really jumps when you go to the dev set. <strong>So this is a data mismatch problem, where data mismatched. So this is a data mismatch problem, because your learning algorithm was not trained explicitly on data from training-dev or dev, but these two data sets come from different distributions. But whatever algorithm it’s learning, it works great on training-dev but it doesn’t work well on dev. So somehow your algorithm has learned to do well on a different distribution than what you really care about, so we call that a data mismatch problem</strong>. </p>
<p>Let’s just look at a few more examples. I’ll write this on the next row since I’m running out of space on top. So Training error, Training-Dev error, and Dev error. Let’s say that <strong>training error is 10%</strong>, <strong>training-dev error is 11%</strong>, and <strong>dev error is 12%</strong>. Remember that <strong>human level proxy for Bayes error is roughly 0%.</strong> So if you have this type of performance, <strong>then you really have a bias, an avoidable bias problem</strong>, because you’re doing much worse than human level. So this is really a high bias setting. </p>
<p>And one last example. If your <strong>training error is 10%, your training-dev error is 11% and your dev error is 20 %</strong>, then it looks like <strong>this actually has two issues</strong>. <strong>One, the avoidable bias is quite high</strong>, because you’re not even doing that well on the training set. <strong>Humans get nearly 0% error</strong>, but you’re getting 10% error on your training set. The variance here seems quite small, but this data mismatch is quite large. <strong>So for for this example I will say, you have a large bias or avoidable bias problem as well as a data mismatch problem</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/12.png" alt=""><br>So let’s take what we’ve done on this slide and write out the general principles. <strong>The key quantities I would look at are human level error, your training set error, your training-dev set error. So that’s the same distribution as the training set, but you didn’t train explicitly on it. Your dev set error, and depending on the differences between these errors, you can get a sense of how big is the avoidable bias, the variance, the data mismatch problems</strong>. So let’s say that human level error is 4%. Your training error is 7%. And your training-dev error is 10%. And the dev error is 12%. So this gives you a sense of the avoidable bias. because you know, you’d like your algorithm to do at least as well or approach human level performance maybe on the training set. This is a sense of the variance. So how well do you generalize from the training set to the training-dev set? This is the sense of how much of a data mismatch problem have you have. And technically you could also add one more thing, which is the test set performance, and we’ll write test error. You shouldn’t be doing development on your test set because you don’t want to overfit your test set. But if you also look at this, then this gap here tells you the degree of overfitting to the dev set. <strong>So if there’s a huge gap between your dev set performance and your test set performance, it means you maybe overtuned to the dev set.</strong> And so maybe you need to find a bigger dev set, right? So remember that <strong>your dev set and your test set come from the same distribution. So the only way for there to be a huge gap here, for it to do much better on the dev set than the test set, is if you somehow managed to overfit the dev set. And if that’s the case, what you might consider doing is going back and just getting more dev set data</strong>. Now, I’ve written these numbers, as you go down the list of numbers, always keep going up. </p>
<p>Here’s one example of numbers that doesn’t always go up, maybe <strong>human level performance is 4%</strong>, <strong>training error is 7%</strong>, <strong>training-dev error is 10</strong>%, but let’s say that we go to the dev set. You find that you actually, <strong>surprisingly, do much better on the dev set. Maybe this is 6%, 6% as well.</strong> So you have seen effects like this, working on for example a speech recognition task, where the training data turned out to be much harder than your dev set and test set. So these two were evaluated on your training set distribution and these two were evaluated on your dev/test set distribution. So sometimes if your dev/test set distribution is much easier for whatever application you’re working on then these numbers can actually go down. So if you see funny things like this, there’s an even more general formulation of this analysis that might be helpful. Let me quickly explain that on the next slide. </p>
<p>So, let me motivate this using the speech activated rear-view mirror example. <strong>It turns out that the numbers we’ve been writing down can be placed into a table</strong> where on the horizontal axis, I’m going to place different data sets. So for example, you might have data from your general speech recognition task. So you might have a bunch of data that you just collected from a lot of speech recognition problems you worked on from small speakers, data you have purchased and so on. And then you all have the rear view mirror specific speech data, recorded inside the car. So on this x axis on the table, I’m going to vary the data set. On this other axis, I’m going to label different ways or algorithms for examining the data. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/13.png" alt=""><br>So first, there’s human level performance, which is how accurate are humans on each of these data sets? Then there is the error on the examples that your neural network has trained on. And then finally there’s error on the examples that your neural network has not trained on. So turns out that what we’re calling on a human level on the previous slide, there’s the number that goes in this box, which is how well do humans do on this category of data. Say data from all sorts of speech recognition tasks, the thousand utterances that you could into your training set. And the example in the previous slide is this 4%. This number here was our, maybe the training error. Which in the example in the previous slide was 7% Right, if you’re learning algorithm has seen this example, performed gradient descent on this example, and this example came from your training set distribution, or some general speech recognition distribution. How well does your algorithm do on the example it has trained on? Then here is the training-dev set error. It’s usually a bit higher, which is for data from this distribution, from general speech recognition, if your algorithm did not train explicitly on some examples from this distribution, how well does it do? And that’s what we call the training dev error. And then if you move over to the right, this box here is the dev set error, or maybe also the test set error. Which was 6% in the example just now. And dev and test error, it’s actually technically two numbers, but either one could go into this box here. And this is if you have data from your rearview mirror, from actually recorded in the car from the rearview mirror application, but your neural network did not perform back propagation on this example, what is the error? So what we’re doing in the analysis in the previous slide was look at differences between these two numbers, these two numbers, and these two numbers. And this gap here is a measure of avoidable bias. This gap here is a measure of variance, and this gap here was a measure of data mismatch. And it turns out that it could be useful to also throw in the remaining two entries in this table. And so if this turns out to be also 6%, and the way you get this number is you ask some humans to label their rearview mirror speech data and just measure how good humans are at this task. And maybe this turns out also to be 6%. And the way you do that is you take some rearview mirror speech data, put it in the training set so the neural network learns on it as well, and then you measure the error on that subset of the data. But if this is what you get, then, well, it turns out that you’re actually already performing at the level of humans on this rearview mirror speech data, so maybe you’re actually doing quite well on that distribution of data. When you do this more subsequent analysis, it doesn’t always give you one clear path forward, but sometimes it just gives you additional insights as well. So for example, comparing these two numbers in this case tells us that for humans, the rearview mirror speech data is actually harder than for general speech recognition, because humans get 6% error, rather than 4% error. But then looking at these differences as well may help you understand bias and variance and data mismatch problems in different degrees. So this more general formulation is something I’ve used a few times. I’ve not used it, but for a lot of problems you find that examining this subset of entries, kind of looking at this difference and this difference and this difference, that that’s enough to point you in a pretty promising direction. But sometimes filling out this whole table can give you additional insights. </p>
<p>Finally, we’ve previously talked a lot about ideas for addressing bias. Talked about techniques on addressing variance, but how do you address data mismatch? In particular training on data that comes from different distribution that your dev and test set can get you more data and really help your learning algorithm’s performance. But rather than just bias and variance problems, you now have this new potential problem of data mismatch. What are some good ways that you could use to address data mismatch? I’ll be honest and say there actually aren’t great or at least not very systematic ways to address data mismatch. But there are some things you could try that could help. Let’s take a look at them in the next video. So what we’ve seen is that by using training data that can come from a different distribution as a dev and test set, this could give you a lot more data and therefore help the performance of your learning algorithm. <strong>But instead of just having bias and variance as two potential problems, you now have this third potential problem, data mismatch. So what if you perform error analysis and conclude that data mismatch is a huge source of error, how do you go about addressing that? It turns out that unfortunately there are super systematic ways to address data mismatch, but there are a few things you can try that could help</strong>. Let’s take a look at them in the next video. </p>
<h3 id="03-addressing-data-mismatch"><a href="#03-addressing-data-mismatch" class="headerlink" title="03_addressing-data-mismatch"></a>03_addressing-data-mismatch</h3><p>If your training set comes from a different distribution, than your dev and test set, and if error analysis shows you that you have a data mismatch problem, what can you do? There are completely systematic solutions to this, but let’s look at some things you could try. </p>
<p><strong>If I find that I have a large data mismatch problem, what I usually do is carry out manual error analysis and try to understand the differences between the training set and the dev/test sets. To avoid overfitting the test set, technically for error analysis, you should manually only look at a dev set and not at the test set</strong>. </p>
<p>But as a concrete example, if you’re building the <strong>speech-activated rear-view mirror application</strong>, you might look or, I guess if it’s speech, listen to examples in your dev set to try to figure out how your dev set is different than your training set. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/14.png" alt=""><br>So, for example, you might find that a lot of dev set examples are very noisy and there’s <strong>a lot of car noise</strong>. And this is one way that your dev set differs from your training set. And maybe you find other categories of errors. For example, in the speech-activated rear-view mirror in your car, you might find that it’s often <strong>mis-recognizing street numbers</strong> because there are <strong>a lot more navigational queries which will have street address. So, getting street numbers right is really important. When you have insight into the nature of the dev set errors, or you have insight into how the dev set may be different or harder than your training set, what you can do is then try to find ways to make the training data more similar. Or, alternatively, try to collect more data similar to your dev and test sets</strong>. </p>
<p>So, <strong>for example, if you find that car noise in the background is a major source of error, one thing you could do is simulate noisy in-car data</strong>. So a little bit more about how to do this on the next slide. Or you find that you’re having a hard time recognizing street numbers, maybe you can go and deliberately try to get more data of people speaking out numbers and add that to your training set. Now, I realize that this slide is giving a rough guideline for things you could try. <strong>This isn’t a systematic process and, I guess, it’s no guarantee that you get the insights you need to make progress. But I have found that this manual insight, together we’re trying to make the data more similar on the dimensions that matter that this often helps on a lot of the problems.</strong> So, if your goal is to make the training data more similar to your dev set, what are some things you can do? </p>
<p>One of the techniques you can use is artificial data synthesis and let’s discuss that in the context of addressing the car noise problem. So, to build a speech recognition system, maybe you don’t have a lot of audio that was actually recorded inside the car with the background noise of a car, background noise of a highway, and so on. But, it turns out, there’s a way to synthesize it. So, let’s say that you’ve recorded a large amount of clean audio without this car background noise. So, here’s an example of a clip you might have in your training set.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/15.png" alt=""><br>By the way, this sentence is used a lot in AI for testing because this is a short sentence that contains every alphabet from A to Z, so you see this sentence a lot. But, given that recording of “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,” you can then also get a recording of car noise like this. So, that’s what the inside of a car sounds like, if you’re driving in silence. And if you take these two audio clips and add them together, you can then synthesize what saying “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” would sound like, if you were saying that in a noisy car. So, it sounds like this. So, <strong>this is a relatively simple audio synthesis example</strong>. In practice, you might synthesize other audio effects like reverberation which is the sound of your voice bouncing off the walls of the car and so on. <strong>But through artificial data synthesis, you might be able to quickly create more data that sounds like it was recorded inside the car without needing to go out there and collect tons of data, maybe thousands or tens of thousands of hours of data in a car that’s actually driving along. So, if your error analysis shows you that you should try to make your data sound more like it was recorded inside the car, then this could be a reasonable process for synthesizing that type of data to give you a learning algorithm</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Now, there is one note of caution I want to sound on artificial data synthesis</strong> which is that, let’s say, you have 10,000 hours of data that was recorded against a quiet background. And, let’s say, that you have just one hour of car noise. <strong>So, one thing you could try is take this one hour of car noise and repeat it 10,000 times in order to add to this 10,000 hours of data recorded against a quiet background. If you do that, the audio will sound perfectly fine to the human ear, but there is a chance, there is a risk that your learning algorithm will over fit to the one hour of car noise.</strong> And, in particular, if this is the set of all audio that you could record in the car or, maybe the sets of all car noise backgrounds you can imagine, if you have just one hour of car noise background, you might be simulating just a very small subset of this space. You might be just synthesizing from a very small subset of this space. <strong>And to the human ear, all these audio sounds just fine because one hour of car noise sounds just like any other hour of car noise to the human ear. But, it’s possible that you’re synthesizing data from a very small subset of this space, and the neural network might be overfitting to the one hour of car noise that you may have. I don’t know if it will be practically feasible to inexpensively collect 10,000 hours of car noise so that you don’t need to repeat the same one hour of car noise over and over but you have 10,000 unique hours of car noise to add to 10,000 hours of unique audio recording against a clean background. But it’s possible, no guarantees. But it is possible that using 10,000 hours of unique car noise rather than just one hour, that could result in better performance through learning algorithm</strong>. And the challenge with artificial data synthesis is to the human ear, as far as your ears can tell, these 10,000 hours all sound the same as this one hour, so you might end up creating this very impoverished synthesized data set from a much smaller subset of the space without actually realizing it. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/16.png" alt=""><br>Here’s another example of artificial data synthesis. Let’s say you’re <strong>building a self driving car</strong> and so you want to really detect vehicles like this and put a bounding box around it let’s say. <strong>So, one idea that a lot of people have discussed is, well, why should you use computer graphics to simulate tons of images of cars?</strong> And, in fact, here are a couple of pictures of cars that were generated using computer graphics. And I think these graphics effects are actually pretty good and I can imagine that by synthesizing pictures like these, you could train a pretty good computer vision system for detecting cars. <strong>Unfortunately, the picture that I drew on the previous slide again applies in this setting. Maybe this is the set of all cars and, if you synthesize just a very small subset of these cars, then to the human eye, maybe the synthesized images look fine. But you might overfit to this small subset you’re synthesizing</strong>. In particular, one idea that a lot of people have independently raised is, once you find a video game with good computer graphics of cars and just grab images from them and get a huge data set of pictures of cars, it turns out that if you look at a video game, if the video game has just 20 unique cars in the video game, then the video game looks fine because you’re driving around in the video game and you see these 20 other cars and it looks like a pretty realistic simulation. But the world has a lot more than 20 unique designs of cars, and if your entire synthesized training set has only 20 distinct cars, then your neural network will probably overfit to these 20 cars. <strong>And it’s difficult for a person to easily tell that, even though these images look realistic, you’re really covering such a tiny subset of the sets of all possible cars.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>So, to summarize, if you think you have a data mismatch problem, I recommend you do error analysis, or look at the training set, or look at the dev set to try this figure out, to try to gain insight into how these two distributions of data might differ. And then see if you can find some ways to get more training data that looks a bit more like your dev set. One of the ways we talked about is artificial data synthesis. And artificial data synthesis does work.</strong> In speech recognition, I’ve seen artificial data synthesis significantly boost the performance of what were already very good speech recognition system. So, it can work very well. <strong>But, if you’re using artificial data synthesis, just be cautious and bear in mind whether or not you might be accidentally simulating data only from a tiny subset of the space of all possible examples. So, that’s it for how to deal with data mismatch.</strong> Next, I like to share with you some thoughts on how to learn from multiple types of data at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="03-learning-from-multiple-tasks"><a href="#03-learning-from-multiple-tasks" class="headerlink" title="03_learning-from-multiple-tasks"></a>03_learning-from-multiple-tasks</h2><h3 id="01-transfer-learning"><a href="#01-transfer-learning" class="headerlink" title="01_transfer-learning"></a>01_transfer-learning</h3><p>One of the most powerful ideas in deep learning is that sometimes you can take knowledge the neural network has learned from one task and apply that knowledge to a separate task. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/18.png" alt=""><br>So for example, maybe you could have the neural network learn to recognize objects like cats and then use that knowledge or use part of that knowledge to help you do a better job reading x-ray scans. This is called <strong>transfer learning</strong>. Let’s take a look. <strong>Let’s say you’ve trained your neural network on image recognition. So you first take a neural network and train it on X Y pairs, where X is an image and Y is some object. An image is a cat or a dog or a bird or something else. If you want to take this neural network and adapt, or we say transfer, what is learned to a different task</strong>, such as radiology diagnosis, meaning really reading X-ray scans, <strong>what you can do is take this last output layer of the neural network and just delete that and delete also the weights feeding into that last output layer and create a new set of randomly initialized weights just for the last layer</strong> and have that now output radiology diagnosis. So to be concrete, during the first phase of training when you’re training on an image recognition task, you train all of the usual parameters for the neural network, all the weights, all the layers and you have something that now learns to make image recognition predictions. </p>
<p><strong>Having trained that neural network, what you now do to implement transfer learning is</strong> swap in a new data set X Y, where now these are radiology images. And Y are the diagnoses you want to predict and <strong>what you do is initialize the last layers’ weights. Let’s call that W.L. and P.L. randomly. And now, retrain the neural network on this new data set, on the new radiology data set.</strong> You have a couple options of how you retrain neural network with radiology data. You might, if you have a small radiology dataset, you might want to just retrain the weights of the last layer, just W.L. P.L., and keep the rest of the parameters fixed. If you have enough data, you could also retrain all the layers of the rest of the neural network. <strong>And the rule of thumb is maybe if you have a small data set, then just retrain the one last layer at the output layer. Or maybe that last one or two layers. But if you have a lot of data, then maybe you can retrain all the parameters in the network.</strong> And if you retrain all the parameters in the neural network, then this initial phase of training on image recognition is sometimes called <strong>pre-training</strong>, because you’re using image recognitions data to pre-initialize or really pre-train the weights of the neural network. And then if you are updating all the weights afterwards, then training on the radiology data sometimes that’s called <strong>fine tuning</strong>. <strong>So you hear the words pre-training and fine tuning in a deep learning context, this is what they mean when they refer to pre-training and fine tuning weights in a transfer learning source.</strong> </p>
<p>And what you’ve done in this example, is you’ve taken knowledge learned from image recognition and applied it or transferred it to radiology diagnosis. And the reason this can be helpful is that a lot of the low level features such as detecting edges, detecting curves, detecting positive objects. Learning from that, from a very large image recognition data set, might help your learning algorithm do better in radiology diagnosis. It’s just learned a lot about the structure and the nature of how images look like and some of that knowledge will be useful. <strong>So having learned to recognize images, it might have learned enough about you know, just what parts of different images look like, that that knowledge about lines, dots, curves, and so on, maybe small parts of objects, that knowledge could help your radiology diagnosis network learn a bit faster or learn with less data</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/19.png" alt=""><br>Here’s another example. Let’s say that you’ve trained <strong>a speech recognition system</strong> so now <strong>X is input of audio or audio snippets, and Y is some ink transcript</strong>. So you’ve trained in speech recognition system to output your transcripts. And let’s say that <strong>you now want to build a “wake words” or a “trigger words” detection system</strong>. So, recall that a wake word or the trigger word are the words we say in order to wake up speech control devices in our houses such as saying “Alexa” to wake up an Amazon Echo or “OK Google” to wake up a Google device or “hey Siri” to wake up an Apple device or saying “Ni hao baidu” to wake up a baidu device. <strong>So in order to do this, you might take out the last layer of the neural network again and create a new output node. But sometimes another thing you could do is actually create not just a single new output, but actually create several new layers to your neural network to try to put the labels Y for your wake word detection problem. Then again, depending on how much data you have, you might just retrain the new layers of the network or maybe you could retrain even more layers of this neural network.</strong> </p>
<p>So, when does transfer learning make sense? <strong>Transfer learning makes sense when you have a lot of data for the problem you’re transferring from and usually relatively less data for the problem you’re transferring to</strong>. </p>
<p>So for example, let’s say you have a million examples for image recognition task. So that’s a lot of data to learn a lot of low level features or to learn a lot of useful features in the earlier layers in neural network. But for the radiology task, maybe you have only a hundred examples. So you have very low data for the radiology diagnosis problem, maybe only 100 x-ray scans. So a lot of knowledge you learn from English recognition can be transferred and can really help you get going with radiology recognition even if you don’t have all the data for radiology. For speech recognition, maybe you’ve trained the speech recognition system on 10000 hours of data. So, you’ve learned a lot about what human voices sounds like from that 10000 hours of data, which really is a lot. </p>
<p>But for your trigger word detection, maybe you have only one hour of data. So, that’s not a lot of data to fit a lot of parameters. So in this case, a lot of what you learn about what human voices sound like, what are components of human speech and so on, that can be really helpful for building a good wake word detector, even though you have a relatively small dataset or at least a much smaller dataset for the wake word detection task. <strong>So in both of these cases, you’re transferring from a problem with a lot of data to a problem with relatively little data. One case where transfer learning would not make sense, is if the opposite was true</strong>. So, if you had a hundred images for image recognition and you had 100 images for radiology diagnosis or even a thousand images for radiology diagnosis, one would think about it is that to do well on radiology diagnosis, assuming what you really want to do well on this radiology diagnosis, having radiology images is much more valuable than having cat and dog and so on images. So each example here is much more valuable than each example there, at least for the purpose of building a good radiology system. So, if you already have more data for radiology, it’s not that likely that having 100 images of your random objects of cats and dogs and cars and so on will be that helpful, because the value of one example of image from your image recognition task of cats and dogs is just less valuable than one example of an x-ray image for the task of building a good radiology system. So, this would be one example where transfer learning, well, it might not hurt but I wouldn’t expect it to give you any meaningful gain either. And similarly, if you’d built a speech recognition system on 10 hours of data and you actually have 10 hours or maybe even more, say 50 hours of data for wake word detection, you know it won’t, it may or may not hurt, maybe it won’t hurt to include that 10 hours of data to your transfer learning, but you just wouldn’t expect to get a meaningful gain. </p>
<p><strong>So to summarize, when does transfer learning make sense? If you’re trying to learn from some Task A and transfer some of the knowledge to some Task B, then transfer learning makes sense when Task A and B have the same input X. In the first example, A and B both have images as input. In the second example, both have audio clips as input. It has to make sense when you have a lot more data for Task A than for Task B. All this is under the assumption that what you really want to do well on is Task B. And because data for Task B is more valuable for Task B, usually you just need a lot more data for Task A because you know, each example from Task A is just less valuable for Task B than each example for Task B. And then finally, transfer learning will tend to make more sense if you suspect that low level features from Task A could be helpful for learning Task B.</strong> And in both of the earlier examples, maybe learning image recognition teaches you enough about images to have a radiology diagnosis and maybe learning speech recognition teaches you about human speech to help you with trigger word or wake word detection. </p>
<p><strong>So to summarize, transfer learning has been most useful if you’re trying to do well on some Task B, usually a problem where you have relatively little data.</strong> So for example, in radiology, you know it’s difficult to get that many x-ray scans to build a good radiology diagnosis system. So in that case, you might find a related but different task, such as image recognition, where you can get maybe a million images and learn a lot of load-over features from that, so that you can then try to do well on Task B on your radiology task despite not having that much data for it. When transfer learning makes sense? It does help the performance of your learning task significantly. But I’ve also seen sometimes seen transfer learning applied in settings where Task A actually has less data than Task B and in those cases, you kind of don’t expect to see much of a gain. </p>
<p>So, that’s it for transfer learning where you learn from one task and try to transfer to a different task. There’s another version of learning from multiple tasks which is called multitask learning, which is when you try to learn from multiple tasks at the same time rather than learning from one and then sequentially, or after that, trying to transfer to a different task. So in the next video, let’s discuss multitasking learning.</p>
<h3 id="02-multi-task-learning"><a href="#02-multi-task-learning" class="headerlink" title="02_multi-task-learning"></a>02_multi-task-learning</h3><p>So whereas in transfer learning, you have a sequential process where you learn from task A and then transfer that to task B. <strong>In multi-task learning, you start off simultaneously, trying to have one neural network do several things at the same time. And then each of these task helps hopefully all of the other task</strong>. Let’s look at an example. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/20.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say you’re building an autonomous vehicle, building a self driving car. Then your self driving car would need to detect several different things such as pedestrians, detect other cars, detect stop signs. And also detect traffic lights and also other things. So for example, in this example on the left, there is a stop sign in this image and there is a car in this image but there aren’t any pedestrians or traffic lights. So if this image is an input for an example, x(i), then Instead of having one label y(i), you would actually a four labels. <strong>In this example, there are no pedestrians, there is a car, there is a stop sign and there are no traffic lights. And if you try and detect other things, there may be y(i) has even more dimensions. But for now let’s stick with these four. So y(i) is a 4 by 1 vector</strong>. And if you look at the training test labels as a whole, then similar to before, we’ll stack the training data’s labels horizontally as follows, y(1) up to y(m). Except that now y(i) is a 4 by 1 vector so each of these is a tall column vector. <strong>And so this matrix Y is now a 4 by m matrix, whereas previously, when y was single real number, this would have been a 1 by m matrix. So what you can do is now train a neural network to predict these values of y. So you can have a neural network input x and output now a four dimensional value for y.</strong> Notice here for the output there I’ve drawn four nodes. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/21.png" alt=""><br>And so the first node when we try to predict is there a pedestrian in this picture. The second output will predict is there a car here, predict is there a stop sign and this will predict maybe is there a traffic light. So y hat here is four dimensional. So to train this neural network, you now need to define the loss for the neural network. And so given a predicted output y hat i which is 4 by 1 dimensional. The loss averaged over your entire training set would be 1 over m sum from i = 1 through m, sum from j = 1 through 4 of the losses of the individual predictions. So it’s just summing over at the four components of pedestrian car stop sign traffic lights. And this script L is the usual logistic loss. So just to write this out, this is -yj i log y hat ji- 1- y log 1- y hat. And the main difference compared to the earlier binding classification examples is that you’re now summing over j equals 1 through 4. <strong>And the main difference between this and softmax regression, is that unlike softmax regression, which assigned a single label to single example. This one image can have multiple labels</strong>. So you’re not saying that each image is either a picture of a pedestrian, or a picture of car, a picture of a stop sign, picture of a traffic light. You’re asking for each picture, does it have a pedestrian, or a car a stop sign or traffic light, and multiple objects could appear in the same image. In fact, in the example on the previous slide, we had both a car and a stop sign in that image, but no pedestrians and traffic lights. So you’re not assigning a single label to an image, you’re going through the different classes and asking for each of the classes does that class, does that type of object appear in the image? So that’s why I’m saying that with this setting, one image can have multiple labels. <strong>If you train a neural network to minimize this cost function, you are carrying out multi-task learning. Because what you’re doing is building a single neural network that is looking at each image and basically solving four problems. It’s trying to tell you does each image have each of these four objects in it. And one other thing you could have done is just train four separate neural networks, instead of train one network to do four things. But if some of the earlier features in neural network can be shared between these different types of objects, then you find that training one neural network to do four things results in better performance than training four completely separate neural networks to do the four tasks separately. So that’s the power of multi-task learning.</strong> </p>
<p>And one other detail, so far I’ve described this algorithm as if every image had every single label. <strong>It turns out that multi-task learning also works even if some of the images we’ll label only some of the objects.</strong> So the first training example, let’s say someone, your labeler had told you there’s a pedestrian, there’s no car, but they didn’t bother to label whether or not there’s a stop sign or whether or not there’s a traffic light. And maybe for the second example, there is a pedestrian, there is a car, but again the labeler, when they looked at that image, they just didn’t label it, whether it had a stop sign or whether it had a traffic light, and so on. <strong>And maybe some examples are fully labeled, and maybe some examples, they were just labeling for the presence and absence of cars so there’s some question marks, and so on. So with a data set like this, you can still train your learning algorithm to do four tasks at the same time, even when some images have only a subset of the labels and others are sort of question marks or don’t cares.</strong> And the way you train your algorithm, even when some of these labels are question marks or really unlabeled is that in this sum over j from 1 to 4, you would sum only over values of j with a 0 or 1 label. <strong>So whenever there’s a question mark, you just omit that term from summation but just sum over only the values where there is a label. And so that allows you to use datasets like this as well</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/22.png" alt=""><br>So when does multi-task learning makes sense? So when does multi-task learning make sense? I’ll say it makes sense usually when three things are true. One is if your training on a set of tasks that could benefit from having shared low-level features. So for the autonomous driving example, it makes sense that recognizing traffic lights and cars and pedestrians, those should have similar features that could also help you recognize stop signs, because these are all features of roads. Second, this is less of a hard and fast rule, so this isn’t always true. But what I see from a lot of successful multi-task learning settings is that the amount of data you have for each task is quite similar. So if you recall from transfer learning, you learn from some task A and transfer it to some task B. So if you have a million examples of task A then and 1,000 examples for task B, then all the knowledge you learned from that million examples could really help augment the much smaller data set you have for task B. Well how about multi-task learning? In multi-task learning you usually have a lot more tasks than just two. So maybe you have, previously we had 4 tasks but let’s say you have 100 tasks. And you’re going to do multi-task learning to try to recognize 100 different types of objects at the same time. So what you may find is that you may have 1,000 examples per task and so if you focus on the performance of just one task, let’s focus on the performance on the 100th task, you can call A100. If you are trying to do this final task in isolation, you would have had just a thousand examples to train this one task, this one of the 100 tasks that by training on these 99 other tasks. These in aggregate have 99,000 training examples which could be a big boost, could give a lot of knowledge to argument this otherwise, relatively small 1,000 example training set that you have for task A100. And symmetrically every one of the other 99 tasks can provide some data or provide some knowledge that help every one of the other tasks in this list of 100 tasks. So the second bullet isn’t a hard and fast rule but what I tend to look at is if you focus on any one task, for that to get a big boost for multi-task learning, the other tasks in aggregate need to have quite a lot more data than for that one task. And so one way to satisfy that is if a lot of tasks like we have in this example on the right, and if the amount of data you have in each task is quite similar. But the key really is that if you already have 1,000 examples for 1 task, then for all of the other tasks you better have a lot more than 1,000 examples if those other other task are meant to help you do better on this final task. And finally multi-task learning tends to make more sense when you can train a big enough neural network to do well on all the tasks. So the alternative to multi-task learning would be to train a separate neural network for each task. So rather than training one neural network for pedestrian, car, stop sign, and traffic light detection, you could have trained one neural network for pedestrian detection, one neural network for car detection, one neural network for stop sign detection, and one neural network for traffic light detection. So what a researcher, Rich Carona, found many years ago was that the only times multi-task learning hurts performance compared to training separate neural networks is if your neural network isn’t big enough. But if you can train a big enough neural network, then multi-task learning certainly should not or should very rarely hurt performance. And hopefully it will actually help performance compared to if you were training neural networks to do these different tasks in isolation. </p>
<p><strong>So that’s it for multi-task learning. In practice, multi-task learning is used much less often than transfer learning. I see a lot of applications of transfer learning where you have a problem you want to solve with a small amount of data. So you find a related problem with a lot of data to learn something and transfer that to this new problem. But multi-task learning is just more rare that you have a huge set of tasks you want to use that you want to do well on, you can train all of those tasks at the same time. Maybe the one example is computer vision. In object detection I see more applications of multi-task any where one neural network trying to detect a whole bunch of objects at the same time works better than different neural networks trained separately to detect objects. But I would say that on average transfer learning is used much more today than multi-task learning, but both are useful tools to have in your arsenal</strong>. </p>
<p>So to summarize, multi-task learning enables you to train one neural network to do many tasks and this can give you better performance than if you were to do the tasks in isolation. <strong>Now one note of caution, in practice I see that transfer learning is used much more often than multi-task learning. So I do see a lot of tasks where if you want to solve a machine learning problem but you have a relatively small data set, then transfer learning can really help. Where if you find a related problem but you have a much bigger data set, you can train in your neural network from there and then transfer it to the problem where we have very low data. So transfer learning is used a lot today. There are some applications of transfer multi-task learning as well, but multi-task learning I think is used much less often than transfer learning. And maybe the one exception is computer vision object detection, where I do see a lot of applications of training a neural network to detect lots of different objects. And that works better than training separate neural networks and detecting the visual objects</strong>. But on average I think that even though transfer learning and multi-task learning often you’re presented in a similar way, <strong>in practice I’ve seen a lot more applications of transfer learning than of multi-task learning. I think because often it’s just difficult to set up or to find so many different tasks that you would actually want to train a single neural network for.</strong> Again, with some sort of computer vision, object detection examples being the most notable exception. So that’s it for multi-task learning. Multi-task learning and transfer learning are both important tools to have in your tool bag. And finally, I’d like to move on to discuss end-to-end deep learning. So let’s go onto the next video to discuss end-to-end learning. </p>
<h2 id="04-end-to-end-deep-learning"><a href="#04-end-to-end-deep-learning" class="headerlink" title="04_end-to-end-deep-learning"></a>04_end-to-end-deep-learning</h2><h3 id="01-what-is-end-to-end-deep-learning"><a href="#01-what-is-end-to-end-deep-learning" class="headerlink" title="01_what-is-end-to-end-deep-learning"></a>01_what-is-end-to-end-deep-learning</h3><p>One of the most exciting recent developments in deep learning, has been the rise of end-to-end deep learning. So what is the end-to-end learning? <strong>Briefly, there have been some data processing systems, or learning systems that require multiple stages of processing. And what end-to-end deep learning does, is it can take all those multiple stages, and replace it usually with just a single neural network</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/23.png" alt=""><br>Let’s look at some examples. Take speech recognition as an example, where your goal is to take an input X such an audio clip, and map it to an output Y, which is a transcript of the audio clip. <strong>So traditionally, speech recognition required many stages of processing. First, you will extract some features, some hand-designed features of the audio</strong>. So if you’ve heard of MFCC, that’s an algorithm for extracting a certain set of hand designed features for audio. <strong>And then having extracted some low level features</strong>, you might apply a machine learning algorithm, to find the phonemes in the audio clip. <strong>So phonemes are the basic units of sound.</strong> So for example, the word cat is made out of three sounds. The Cu- Ah- and Tu- so they extract those. <strong>And then you string together phonemes to form individual words. And then you string those together to form the transcripts of the audio clip. So, in contrast to this pipeline with a lot of stages, what end-to-end deep learning does, is you can train a huge neural network to just input the audio clip, and have it directly output the transcript.</strong> One interesting sociological effect in AI is that as end-to-end deep learning started to work better, there were some researchers that had for example spent many years of their career designing individual steps of the pipeline. So there were some researchers in different disciplines not just in speech recognition. Maybe in computer vision, and other areas as well, that had spent a lot of time you know, written multiple papers, maybe even built a large part of their career, engineering featuresor engineering other pieces of the pipeline. And when end-to-end deep learning just took the last training set and learned the function mapping from x and y directly, really bypassing a lot of these intermediate steps, it was challenging for some disciplines to come around to accepting this alternative way of building AI systems. Because it really obsoleted in some cases, many years of research in some of the intermediate components. <strong>It turns out that one of the challenges of end-to-end deep learning is that you might need a lot of data before it works well.</strong> So for example, if you’re training on 3,000 hours of data to build a speech recognition system, then the traditional pipeline, the full traditional pipeline works really well. It’s only when you have a very large data set, you know one to say 10,000 hours of data, anything going up to maybe 100,000 hours of data that the end-to end-approach then suddenly starts to work really well. <strong>So when you have a smaller data set, the more traditional pipeline approach actually works just as well. Often works even better. And you need a large data set before the end-to-end approach really shines. And if you have a medium amount of data, then there are also intermediate approaches where maybe you input audio and bypass the features and just learn to output the phonemes of the neural network, and then at some other stages as well. So this will be a step toward end-to-end learning, but not all the way there</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/24.png" alt=""><br>So this is a picture of <strong>a face recognition turnstile</strong> built by a researcher, Yuanqing Lin at Baidu, where this is a camera and it looks at the person approaching the gate, and if it recognizes the person then, you know the turnstile automatically lets them through. So rather than needing to swipe an RFID badge to enter this facility, in increasingly many offices in China and hopefully more and more in other countries as well, you can just approach the turnstile and if it recognizes your face it just lets you through without needing you to carry an RFID badge. So, how do you build a system like this? Well, one thing you could do is just look at the image that the camera is capturing. Right? So, I guess this is my bad drawing, but maybe this is a camera image. And you know, you have <strong>someone approaching the turnstile. So this might be the image X that you that your camera is capturing. And one thing you could do is try to learn a function mapping directly from the image X to the identity of the person Y. It turns out this is not the best approach. And one of the problems is that you know, the person approaching the turnstile can approach from lots of different directions</strong>. So they could be green positions, they could be in blue position. You know, sometimes they’re closer to the camera, so they appear bigger in the image. And sometimes they’re already closer to the camera, so that face appears much bigger. <strong>So what it has actually done to build these turnstiles, is not to just take the raw image and feed it to a neural net to try to figure out a person’s identity. Instead, the best approach to date, seems to be a multi-step approach, where first, you run one piece of software to detect the person’s face. So this first detector to figure out where’s the person’s face. Having detected the person’s face, you then zoom in to that part of the image and crop that image so that the person’s face is centered.</strong> Then, it is this picture that I guess I drew here in red, this is then fed to the neural network, to then try to learn, or estimate the person’s identity. <strong>And what researchers have found, is that instead of trying to learn everything on one step, by breaking this problem down into two simpler steps, first is figure out where is the face. And second, is look at the face and figure out who this actually is. This second approach allows the learning algorithm or really two learning algorithms to solve two much simpler tasks and results in overall better performance</strong>. By the way, if you want to know how the second step actually works I’ve simplified the discussion. By the way, if you want to know how step two here actually works, I’ve actually simplified the description a bit. <strong>The way the second step is actually trained, as you train in your network, that takes as input two images, and what then your network does is it takes this input two images and it tells you if these two are the same person or not. So if you then have say 10,000 employees IDs on file, you can then take this image in red, and quickly compare it against maybe all 10,000 employee IDs on file to try to figure out if this picture in red is indeed one of your 10000 employees that you should allow into this facility or that should allow into your office building.</strong> This is a turnstile that is giving employees access to a workplace.<strong>So why is it that the two step approach works better? There are actually two reasons for that. One is that each of the two problems you’re solving is actually much simpler. But second, is that you have a lot of data for each of the two sub-tasks. In particular, there is a lot of data you can obtain for phase detection, for task one over here, where the task is to look at an image and figure out where is the person’s face and the image. So there is a lot of data.</strong> There is a lot of label data X, comma Y where X is a picture and y shows the position of the person’s face. <strong>So you could build a neural network to do task one quite well. And then separately, there’s a lot of data for task two as well. Today, leading companies have let’s say, hundreds of millions of pictures of people’s faces. So given a closely cropped image</strong>, like this red image or this one down here, today leading face recognition teams have at least hundreds of millions of images that they could use to look at two images and try to figure out the identity or to figure out if it’s the same person or not. <strong>So there’s also a lot of data for task two. But in contrast, if you were to try to learn everything at the same time, there is much less data of the form X comma Y. Where X is image like this taken from the turnstile, and Y is the identity of the person. So because you don’t have enough data to solve this end-to-end learning problem, but you do have enough data to solve sub-problems one and two, in practice, breaking this down to two sub-problems results in better performance than a pure end-to-end deep learning approach. Although if you had enough data for the end-to-end approach, maybe the end-to-end approach would work better, but that’s not actually what works best in practice today.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/25.png" alt=""><br>Let’s look at a few more examples. Take machine translation. Traditionally, machine translation systems also had a long complicated pipeline, where you first take say English, text and then do text analysis. Basically, extract a bunch of features off the text, and so on. And after many many steps you’d end up with say, a translation of the English text into French. Because, for machine translation, you do have a lot of pairs of English comma French sentences. <strong>End-to-end deep learning works quite well for machine translation. And that’s because today, it is possible to gather large data sets of X-Y pairs where that’s the English sentence and that’s the corresponding French translation. So in this example, end-to-end deep learning works well.</strong> </p>
<p>One last example, let’s say that you want to look at an X-ray picture of a hand of a child, and estimate the age of a child. You know, when I first heard about this problem, I thought this is a very cool crime scene investigation task where you find maybe tragically the skeleton of a child, and you want to figure out how the child was. <strong>It turns out that typical application of this problem, estimating age of a child from an X-ray is less dramatic than this crime scene investigation I was picturing</strong>. It turns out that pediatricians use this to estimate whether or not a child is growing or developing normally. But a non end-to-end approach to this, would be you locate an image and then you segment out or recognize the bones. So, just try to figure out where is that bone segment? Where is that bone segment? Where is that bone segment? And so on. And then. Knowing the lengths of the different bones, you can sort of go to a look up table showing the average bone lengths in a child’s hand and then use that to estimate the child’s age. <strong>And so this approach actually works pretty well. In contrast, if you were to go straight from the image to the child’s age, then you would need a lot of data to do that directly and as far as I know, this approach does not work as well today just because there isn’t enough data to train this task in an end-to-end fashion. Whereas in contrast, you can imagine that by breaking down this problem into two steps.</strong> Step one is a relatively simple problem. Maybe you don’t need that much data. Maybe you don’t need that many X-ray images to segment out the bones. And task two, by collecting statistics of a number of children’s hands, you can also get decent estimates of that without too much data. <strong>So this multi-step approach seems promising. Maybe more promising than the end-to-end approach, at least until you can get more data for the end-to-end learning approach.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>So an end-to-end deep learning works. It can work really well and it can really simplify the system and not require you to build so many hand-designed individual components. But it’s also not panacea, it doesn’t always work.</strong> In the next video, I want to share with you a more systematic description of when you should, and maybe when you shouldn’t use end-to-end deep learning and how to piece together these complex machine learning systems.</p>
<h3 id="02-whether-to-use-end-to-end-deep-learning"><a href="#02-whether-to-use-end-to-end-deep-learning" class="headerlink" title="02_whether-to-use-end-to-end-deep-learning"></a>02_whether-to-use-end-to-end-deep-learning</h3><p>Let’s say in building a machine learning system you’re trying to decide whether or not to use an end-to-end approach. Let’s take a look at some of the pros and cons of end-to-end deep learning so that you can come away with some guidelines on whether or not an end-to-end approach seems promising for your application. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/26.png" alt=""><br>Here are some of the <strong>benefits</strong> of applying end-to-end learning. <strong>First is that end-to-end learning really just lets the data speak</strong>. So if you have enough X,Y data then whatever is the most appropriate function mapping from X to Y, if you train a big enough neural network, hopefully the neural network will figure it out. And by having a pure machine learning approach, your neural network learning input from X to Y may be more able to capture whatever statistics are in the data, rather than being forced to reflect human preconceptions. So for example, in the case of speech recognition earlier speech systems had this notion of a phoneme which was a basic unit of sound like C, A, and T for the word cat. And I think that phonemes are an artifact created by human linguists. I actually think that phonemes are a fantasy of linguists that are a reasonable description of language, but it’s not obvious that you want to force your learning algorithm to think in phonemes. And if you let your learning algorithm learn whatever representation it wants to learn rather than forcing your learning algorithm to use phonemes as a representation, then its overall performance might end up being better. <strong>The second benefit to end-to-end deep learning is that there’s less hand designing of components needed. And so this could also simplify your design work flow, that you just don’t need to spend a lot of time hand designing features, hand designing these intermediate representations</strong>. </p>
<p>How about the <strong>disadvantages</strong>. Here are some of the cons. <strong>First, it may need a large amount of data</strong>. So to learn this X to Y mapping directly, you might need a lot of data of X, Y and we were seeing in a previous video some examples of where you could obtain a lot of data for subtasks. Such as for face recognition, we could find a lot data for finding a face in the image, as well as identifying the face once you found a face, but there was just less data available for the entire end-to-end task. So X, this is the input end of the end-to-end learning and Y is the output end. And so you need all the data X Y with both the input end and the output end in order to train these systems, and this is why we call it end-to-end learning value as well because you’re learning a direct mapping from one end of the system all the way to the other end of the system. <strong>The other disadvantage is that it excludes potentially useful hand designed components</strong>. So machine learning researchers tend to speak disparagingly of hand designing things. But if you don’t have a lot of data, then your learning algorithm doesn’t have that much insight it can gain from your data. <strong>If your training set is small. And so hand designing a component can really be a way for you to inject manual knowledge into the algorithm, and that’s not always a bad thing.</strong> I think of a learning algorithm as having two main sources of knowledge. One is the data and the other is whatever you hand design, be it components, or features, or other things. And so when you have a ton of data it’s less important to hand design things but when you don’t have much data, then having a carefully hand-designed system can actually allow humans to inject a lot of knowledge about the problem into an algorithm deck and that should be very helpful. So one of the downsides of end-to-end deep learning is that it excludes potentially useful hand-designed components. <strong>And hand-designed components could be very helpful if well designed. They could also be harmful if it really limits your performance, such as if you force an algorithm to think in phonemes when maybe it could have discovered a better representation by itself. So it’s kind of a double edged sword that could hurt or help but it does tend to help more, hand-designed components tend to help more when you’re training on a small training set</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>So if you’re building a new machine learning system and you’re trying to decide whether or not to use end-to-end deep learning, I think the key question is, do you have sufficient data to learn the function of the complexity needed to map from X to Y?</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/27.png" alt=""><br>I don’t have a formal definition of this phrase, <strong>complexity</strong> needed, but intuitively, if you’re trying to learn a function from X to Y, that is looking at an image like this and <strong>recognizing the position of the bones in this image</strong>, then maybe this seems like a relatively simple problem to identify the bones of the image and maybe they’ll need that much data for that task. Or given a picture of a person, maybe finding the face of that person in the image doesn’t seem like that hard a problem, so maybe you don’t need too much data to find the face of a person. Or at least maybe you can find enough data to solve that task, <strong>whereas in contrast, the function needed to look at the hand and map that directly to the age of the child, that seems like a much more complex problem that intuitively maybe you need more data to learn if you were to apply a pure end-to-end deep learning approach</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/28.png" alt=""><br>So let me finish this video with a more complex example. You may know that I’ve been spending time helping out an <strong>autonomous driving</strong> company, Drive.ai. So I’m actually very excited about autonomous driving. So how do you build a car that drives itself? Well, here’s one thing you could do, and this is not an end-to-end deep learning approach. You can take as input an image of what’s in front of your car, maybe radar, lighter, other sensor readings as well, but to simplify the description, let’s just say you take a picture of what’s in front or what’s around your car. And then to drive your car safely you need to <strong>detect other cars</strong> and you also need to <strong>detect pedestrians</strong>. You need to <strong>detect other things</strong>, of course, but we’ll just present a simplified example here. <strong>Having figured out where are the other cars and pedestrians, you then need to plan your own route.</strong> So in other words, if you see where are the other cars, where are the pedestrians, <strong>you need to decide how to steer your own car, what path to steer your own car for the next several seconds.</strong> And having decided that you’re going to drive a certain path, maybe this is a top down view of a road and that’s your car. Maybe you’ve decided to drive that path, that’s what a route is, then you need to execute this by generating the appropriate steering, as well as acceleration and braking commands. So in going from your image or your sensory inputs to detecting cars and pedestrians, that can be done pretty well using deep learning, but then <strong>having figured out where the other cars and pedestrians are going, to select this route to exactly how you want to move your car, usually that’s not to done with deep learning. Instead that’s done with a piece of software called Motion Planning</strong>. And if you ever take a course in robotics you’ll learn about <strong>motion planning</strong>. <strong>And then having decided what’s the path you want to steer your car through, there’ll be some other algorithm, we’re going to say it’s a control algorithm that then generates the exact decision, that then decides exactly how much to turn the steering wheel and how much to step on the accelerator or step on the brake</strong>. So I think what this example illustrates is that you want to use machine learning or use deep learning to learn some individual components and when applying supervised learning you should carefully choose what types of X to Y mappings you want to learn depending on what task you can get data for. And in contrast, it is exciting to talk about a pure end-to-end deep learning approach where you input the image and directly output a steering. But given data availability and the types of things we can learn with neural networks today, this is actually not the most promising approach or this is not an approach that I think teams have gotten to work best. <strong>And I think this pure end-to-end deep learning approach is actually less promising than more sophisticated approaches like this, given the availability of data and our ability to train neural networks today</strong>. </p>
<p>So that’s it for end-to-end deep learning. It can sometimes work really well but you also have to be mindful of where you apply end-to-end deep learning. Finally, thank you and congrats on making it this far with me. If you finish last week’s videos and this week’s videos then I think you will already be much smarter and much more strategic and much more able to make good prioritization decisions in terms of how to move forward on your machine learning project, even compared to a lot of machine learning engineers and researchers that I see here in Silicon Valley. So congrats on all that you’ve learned so far and I hope you now also take a look at this week’s homework problems which should give you another opportunity to practice these ideas and make sure that you’re mastering them.</p>

          <h2 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h2><p>This is my personal note after studying the course of the first week  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Structuring Machine Learning Projects</a> and the copyright belongs to <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeplearning.ai</a>.</p>

I hope that through this course you will learn how to much more quickly and efficiently get your machine learning systems working. So, what is machine learning strategy.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/1.png" alt=""><br>Let’s start with a motivating example. Let’s say you are working on your cat cost file. And after working it for some time, you’ve gotten your system to have 90% accuracy, but this isn’t good enough for your application. You might then have a lot of ideas as to how to improve your system. For example, you might think well let’s collect more data, more training data. Or you might say, maybe your training set isn’t diverse enough yet, you should collect images of cats in more diverse poses, or maybe a more diverse set of negative examples. Well maybe you want to train the algorithm longer with gradient descent. Or maybe you want to try a different optimization algorithm, like the Adam optimization algorithm. Or maybe trying a bigger network or a smaller network or maybe you want to try to dropout or maybe L2 regularization. Or maybe you want to change the network architecture such as changing activation functions, changing the number of hidden units and so on and so on. </p>
<p><strong>When trying to improve a deep learning system, you often have a lot of ideas or things you could try. And the problem is that if you choose poorly, it is entirely possible that you end up spending six months charging in some direction only to realize after six months that that didn’t do any good</strong>. For example, I’ve seen some teams spend literally six months collecting more data only to realize after six months that it barely improved the performance of their system. So, assuming you don’t have six months to waste on your problem, won’t it be nice if you had quick and effective ways to figure out which of all of these ideas and maybe even other ideas, are worth pursuing and which ones you can safely discard. </p>
<p><strong>So what I hope to do in this course is teach you a number of strategies, that is, ways of analyzing a machine learning problem that will point you in the direction of the most promising things to try. What I will do in this course also is share with you a number of lessons I’ve learned through building and shipping large number of deep learning products</strong>. And I think these materials are actually quite unique to this course. I don’t see a lot of these ideas being taught in universities’ deep learning courses for example. It turns out also that machine learning strategy is changing in the era of deep learning because the things you could do are now different with deep learning algorithms than with previous generation of machine learning algorithms. I hope that these ideas will help you become much more effective at getting your deep learning systems to work.</p>
<h3 id="02-orthogonalization"><a href="#02-orthogonalization" class="headerlink" title="02_orthogonalization"></a>02_orthogonalization</h3><p>One of the challenges with building machine learning systems is that there’s so many things you could try, so many things you could change. Including, for example, so many hyperparameters you could tune. One of the things I’ve noticed is about the most effective machine learning people is they’re very clear-eyed about what to tune in order to try to achieve one effect. This is a process we call orthogonalization. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/2.png" alt=""><br>Let me tell you what I mean. Here’s a picture of an old school television, with a lot of knobs that you could tune to adjust the picture in various ways. So for these old TV sets, maybe there was one knob to adjust how <strong>tall</strong> vertically your image is and another knob to adjust how <strong>wide</strong> it is. Maybe another knob to adjust how <strong>trapezoidal</strong> it is, another knob to adjust how much to move the picture <strong>left and right</strong>, another one to adjust how much the picture’s <strong>rotated</strong>, and so on. And what TV designers had spent a lot of time doing was to build the circuitry, really often analog circuitry back then, to make sure each of the knobs had a relatively interpretable function. Such as one knob to tune this  (height), one knob to tune this (width), one knob to tune this (trapezoidal), and so on. <strong>In contrast, imagine if you had a knob that</strong> tunes 0.1 x how tall the image is, + 0.3 x how wide the image is,- 1.7 x how trapezoidal the image is, + 0.8 times the position of the image on the horizontal axis, and so on(that is conbining all various functions). <strong>If you tune this knob, then the height of the image, the width of the image, how trapezoidal it is, how much it shifts, it all changes all at the same time. If you have a knob like that, it’d be almost impossible to tune the TV so that the picture gets centered in the display area. So in this context, orthogonalization refers to that the TV designers had designed the knobs so that each knob kind of does only one thing. And this makes it much easier to tune the TV, so that the picture gets centered where you want it to be</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/3.png" alt=""><br>Here’s another example of orthogonalization. If you think about learning to drive a car, a car has three main controls, which are steering, the steering wheel decides how much you go left or right, acceleration, and braking. <strong>So these three controls, or really one control for steering and another two controls for your speed. it makes it relatively interpretable, what your different actions through different controls will do to your car</strong>. But now imagine if someone were to build a car so that there was a joystick, where one axis of the joystick controls 0.3 x your steering angle,- 0.8 x your speed. And you had a different control that controls 2 x the steering angle, + 0.9 x the speed of your car. In theory, by tuning these two knobs, you could get your car to steer at the angle and at the speed you want. But it’s much harder than if you had just one single control for controlling the steering angle, and a separate, distinct set of controls for controlling the speed. <strong>So the concept of orthogonalization refers to that, if you think of one dimension of what you want to do as controlling a steering angle, and another dimension as controlling your speed. Then you want one knob to just affect the steering angle as much as possible, and another knob, in the case of the car, is really acceleration and braking, that controls your speed. But if you had a control that mixes the two together, like a control like this one that affects both your steering angle and your speed, something that changes both at the same time, then it becomes much harder to set the car to the speed and angle you want.</strong> And by having orthogonal, orthogonal means at <strong>90 degrees</strong> to each other. By having orthogonal controls that are ideally aligned with the things you actually want to control, it makes it much easier to tune the knobs you have to tune. To tune the steering wheel angle, and your accelerator, your braking, to get the car to do what you want. <strong>So how does this relate to machine learning?</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/4.png" alt=""><br><strong>For a supervised learning system to do well, you usually need to tune the knobs of your system to make sure that four things hold true. First, is that you usually have to make sure that you’re at least doing well on the training set. So performance on the training set needs to pass some acceptability assessment.</strong> For some applications, this might mean doing comparably to human level performance. But this will depend on your application, and we’ll talk more about comparing to human level performance next week. But after doing well on the training sets, you then hope that this leads to also doing well on the dev set. And you then hope that this also does well on the test set. And finally, you hope that doing well on the test set on the cost function results in your system performing in the real world. So you hope that this resolves in happy cat picture app users, for example. </p>
<p><strong>So to relate back to the TV tuning example, if the picture of your TV was either too wide or too narrow, you wanted one knob to tune in order to adjust that. You don’t want to have to carefully adjust five different knobs, which also affect different things. You want one knob to just affect the width of your TV image. So in a similar way, if your algorithm is not fitting the training set well on the cost function, you want one knob, yes, that’s my attempt to draw a knob. Or maybe one specific set of knobs that you can use, to make sure you can tune your algorithm to make it fit well on the training set.</strong> So the knobs you use to tune this are, you might train a bigger network. Or you might switch to a better optimization algorithm, like the Adam optimization algorithm, and so on, into some other options we’ll discuss later this week and next week. In contrast, if you find that the algorithm is not fitting the dev set well, then there’s a separate set of knobs. Yes, that’s my not very artistic rendering of another knob, you want to have a distinct set of knobs to try. So for example, if your algorithm is not doing well on the dev set, it’s doing well on the training set but not on the dev set, then you have a set of knobs around regularization that you can use to try to make it satisfy the second criteria. So the analogy is, now that you’ve tuned the width of your TV set, if the height of the image isn’t quite right, then you want a different knob in order to tune the height of the TV image. And you want to do this hopefully without affecting the width of your TV image too much. And getting a bigger training set would be another knob you could use, that helps your learning algorithm generalize better to the dev set. Now, having adjusted the width and height of your TV image, <strong>well, what if it doesn’t meet the third criteria? What if you do well on the dev set but not on the test set? If that happens, then the knob you tune is, you probably want to get a bigger dev set. Because if it does well on the dev set but not the test set, it probably means you’ve overtuned to your dev set, and you need to go back and find a bigger dev set. And finally, if it does well on the test set, but it isn’t delivering to you a happy cat picture app user, then what that means is that you want to go back and change either the dev set or the cost function. Because if doing well on the test set according to some cost function doesn’t correspond to your algorithm doing what you need it to do in the real world, then <em>it means that either your dev test set distribution isn’t set correctly, or your cost function isn’t measuring the right thing</em>.</strong> I know I’m going over these examples quite quickly, but we’ll go much more into detail on these specific knobs later this week and next week. So if you aren’t following all the details right now, don’t worry about it. But I want to give you a sense of this orthogonalization process, that you want to be very clear about which of these maybe four issues, the different things you could tune, are trying to address. </p>
<p>And when I train a neural network, I tend not to use early stopping. It’s not a bad technique, quite a lot of people do it. But I personally find early stopping difficult to think about. Because this is an op that simultaneously affects how well you fit the training set, because if you stop early, you fit the training set less well. It also simultaneously is often done to improve your dev set performance. So this is one knob that is less orthogonalized, because it simultaneously affects two things. It’s like a knob that simultaneously affects both the width and the height of your TV image. And it doesn’t mean that it’s bad, not to use, you can use it if you want. But when you have more orthogonalized controls, such as these other ones that I’m writing down here, then it just makes the process of tuning your network much easier. </p>
<p>So I hope that gives you a sense of what orthogonalization means. Just like when you look at the TV image, it’s nice if you can say, my TV image is too wide, so I’m going to tune this knob, or it’s too tall, so I’m going to tune that knob, or it’s too trapezoidal, so I’m going to have to tune that knob. In machine learning, it’s nice if you can look at your system and say, this piece of it is wrong. It does not do well on the training set, it does not do well on the dev set, it does not do well on the test set, or it’s doing well on the test set but just not in the real world. <strong>But figure out exactly what’s wrong, and then have exactly one knob, or a specific set of knobs that helps to just solve that problem that is limiting the performance of machine learning system. So what we’re going to do this week and next week is go through how to diagnose what exactly is the bottleneck to your system’s performance. As well as identify the specific set of knobs you could use to tune your system to improve that aspect of its performance.</strong> So let’s start going more into the details of this process. </p>
<h4 id="Orthogonalization"><a href="#Orthogonalization" class="headerlink" title="Orthogonalization"></a>Orthogonalization</h4><p>Orthogonalization or orthogonality is a system design property that assures that modifying an instruction or a component of an algorithm will not create or propagate side effects to other components of the system. It becomes easier to verify the algorithms independently from one another, it reduces testing and development time. When a supervised learning system is design, these are the 4 assumptions that needs to be true and orthogonal.</p>

So when teams are starting on a machine learning project, I often recommend that you set up a single real number evaluation metric for your problem. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/5.png" alt=""><br>Let’s look at an example. You’ve heard me say before that applied machine learning is a very empirical process. We often have an idea, code it up, run the experiment to see how it did, and then use the outcome of the experiment to refine your ideas. And then keep going around this loop as you keep on improving your algorithm. So let’s say for your classifier, you had previously built some classifier A. And by changing the hyperparameters and the training sets or some other thing, you’ve now trained a new classifier, B. So one reasonable way to evaluate the performance of your classifiers is to look at its precision and recall. The exact details of what’s precision and recall don’t matter too much for this example. But briefly, the definition of precision is, of the examples that your classifier recognizes as cats, What percentage actually are cats? So if classifier A has 95% precision, this means that when classifier A says something is a cat, there’s a 95% chance it really is a cat. And recall is, of all the images that really are cats, what percentage were correctly recognized by your classifier? So what percentage of actual cats, Are correctly recognized? So if classifier A is 90% recall, this means that of all of the images in, say, your dev sets that really are cats, classifier A accurately pulled out 90% of them. So don’t worry too much about the definitions of precision and recall. It turns out that there’s often a tradeoff between precision and recall, and you care about both. You want that, when the classifier says something is a cat, there’s a high chance it really is a cat. But of all the images that are cats, you also want it to pull a large fraction of them as cats. So it might be reasonable to try to evaluate the classifiers in terms of its precision and its recall. The problem with using precision recall as your evaluation metric is that if classifier A does better on recall, which it does here, the classifier B does better on precision, then you’re not sure which classifier is better. And if you’re trying out a lot of different ideas, a lot of different hyperparameters, you want to rather quickly try out not just two classifiers, but maybe a dozen classifiers and quickly pick out the, quote, best ones, so you can keep on iterating from there. And with two evaluation metrics, it is difficult to know how to quickly pick one of the two or quickly pick one of the ten. So what I recommend is rather than using two numbers, precision and recall, to pick a classifier, you just have to find a new evaluation metric that combines precision and recall. In the machine learning literature, the standard way to combine precision and recall is something called an F1 score. And the details of F1 score aren’t too important, but informally, you can think of this as the average of precision, P, and recall, R. Formally, the F1 score is defined by this formula, it’s 2/ 1/P + 1/R. And in mathematics, this function is called the harmonic mean of precision P and recall R. But less formally, you can think of this as some way that averages precision and recall. Only instead of taking the arithmetic mean, you take the harmonic mean, which is defined by this formula. And it has some advantages in terms of trading off precision and recall. But in this example, you can then see right away that classifier A has a better F1 score. And assuming F1 score is a reasonable way to combine precision and recall, you can then quickly select classifier A over classifier B. So what I found for a lot of machine learning teams is that having a well-defined dev set, which is how you’re measuring precision and recall, plus a single number evaluation metric, sometimes I’ll call it single real number. Evaluation metric allows you to quickly tell if classifier A or classifier B is better, and <strong>therefore having a dev set plus single number evaluation metric distance to speed up iterating. It speeds up this iterative process of improving your machine learning algorithm</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/6.png" alt=""><br>Let’s look at another example. Let’s say you’re building a cat app for cat lovers in four major geographies, the US, China, India, and other, the rest of the world. And let’s say that your two classifiers achieve different errors in data from these four different geographies. So algorithm A achieves 3% error on pictures submitted by US users and so on. So it might be reasonable to keep track of how well your classifiers do in these different markets or these different geographies. But by tracking four numbers, it’s very difficult to look at these numbers and quickly decide if algorithm A or algorithm B is superior. And if you’re testing a lot of different classifiers, then it’s just difficult to look at all these numbers and quickly pick one. So what I recommend in this example is, <strong>in addition to tracking your performance in the four different geographies, to also compute the average. And assuming that average performance is a reasonable single real number evaluation metric, by computing the average, you can <em>quickly</em> tell that it looks like algorithm C has a lowest average error. And you might then go ahead with that one. You have to pick an algorithm to keep on iterating from.</strong> </p>
<p>So your work load machine learning is often, you have an idea, you implement it try it out, and you want to know whether your idea helped. So what was seen in this video is that having a single number evaluation metric can really improve your efficiency or the efficiency of your team in making those decisions. Now we’re not yet done with the discussion on how to effectively set up evaluation metrics. In the next video, I’m going to share with you how to set up optimizing, as well as satisfying matrix. So let’s take a look at the next video. </p>
<h3 id="02-satisficing-and-optimizing-metric"><a href="#02-satisficing-and-optimizing-metric" class="headerlink" title="02_satisficing-and-optimizing-metric"></a>02_satisficing-and-optimizing-metric</h3><p>It’s not always easy to combine all the things you care about into a single real number evaluation metric. In those cases I’ve found it sometimes useful to set up satisficing as well as optimizing matrix. Let me show you what I mean. </p>
<p>Let’s say that you’ve decided you care about the classification accuracy of your cat’s classifier, this could have been F1 score or some other measure of accuracy, but let’s say that in addition to accuracy you also care about <strong>the running time</strong>.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/7.png" alt=""><br>So how long it takes to classify an image and classifier A takes 80 milliseconds, B takes 95 milliseconds, and C takes 1,500 milliseconds, that’s 1.5 seconds to classify an image. So one thing you could do is combine accuracy and running time into an overall evaluation metric. And so the costs such as maybe the overall cost is accuracy minus 0.5 times running time. But maybe it seems a bit artificial to combine accuracy and running time using a formula like this, like a linear weighted sum of these two things. <strong>So here’s something else you could do instead which is that you might want to choose a classifier that maximizes accuracy but subject to that the running time, that is the time it takes to classify an image</strong>, that that has to be less than or equal to 100 milliseconds. So in this case we would say that accuracy is <strong>an optimizing metric</strong> because you want to maximize accuracy. You want to do as well as possible on accuracy but that running time is what we call <strong>a satisficing metric</strong>. <strong>Meaning that it just has to be good enough, it just needs to be less than 100 milliseconds and beyond that you don’t really care, or at least you don’t care that much. So this will be a pretty reasonable way to trade off or to put together accuracy as well as running time. And it may be the case that so long as the running time is less that 100 milliseconds, your users won’t care that much whether it’s 100 milliseconds or 50 milliseconds or even faster.</strong> And by defining optimizing as well as satisficing matrix, this gives you a clear way to pick the, quote, best classifier, which in this case would be classifier B because of all the ones with a running time better than 100 milliseconds it has the best accuracy. <strong>So more generally, if you have N matrix that you care about it’s sometimes reasonable to pick one of them to be optimizing. So you want to do as well as is possible on that one. And then N minus 1 to be satisficing, meaning that so long as they reach some threshold such as running times faster than 100 milliseconds, but so long as they reach some threshold, you don’t care how much better it is in that threshold, but they have to reach that threshold.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/8.png" alt=""><br>Here’s another example. Let’s say you’re building a system to detect wake words, also called trigger words. So this refers to the voice control devices like the Amazon Echo where you wake up by saying Alexa or some Google devices which you wake up by saying okay Google or some Apple devices which you wake up by saying Hey Siri or some Baidu devices we should wake up by saying you ni hao Baidu. Oh I guess, you want to read the Chinese, that’s ni hao Baidu. Right, so these are the wake words you use to tell one of these voice control devices to wake up and listen to something you want to say. And for these other Chinese characters for ni hao Baidu. So you might care about the accuracy of your trigger word detection system. So when someone says one of these trigger words, how likely are you to actually wake up your device, and you might also care about the number of false positives. So when no one actually said this trigger word, how often does it randomly wake up? So in this case maybe one reasonable way of combining these two evaluation matrix might be to maximize accuracy, so when someone says one of the trigger words, maximize the chance that your device wakes up. And subject to that, you have at most one false positive every 24 hours of operation, right? So that your device randomly wakes up only once per day on average when no one is actually talking to it. So in this case accuracy is the optimizing metric and a number of false positives every 24 hours is the satisficing metric where you’d be satisfied so long as there is at most one false positive every 24 hours. </p>
<p><strong>To summarize, if there are multiple things you care about by say there’s one as the optimizing metric that you want to do as well as possible on and one or more as satisficing metrics were you’ll be satisfice. Almost it does better than some threshold you can now have an almost automatic way of quickly looking at multiple core size and picking the, quote, best one.</strong> Now these evaluation matrix must be evaluated or calculated on a training set or a development set or maybe on the test set. So one of the things you also need to do is set up training, dev or development, as well as test sets. In the next video, I want to share with you some guidelines for how to set up training, dev, and test sets. So let’s go on to the next.</p>
<h4 id="summary"><a href="#summary" class="headerlink" title="summary"></a>summary</h4><p><strong>Satisficing and optimizing metric</strong></p>
<p>There are different metrics to evaluate the performance of a classifier, they are called evaluation matrices.They can be categorized as satisficing and optimizing matrices. It is important to note that these evaluation matrices must be evaluated on a training set, a development set or on the test set.</p>
<p>Example: Cat vs Non-cat<br>|Classifier|Accuracy|Running time|<br>|:-:|:-:|:-:|<br>|A|90%|80ms|<br>|B|92%|95ms|<br>|C|95%|1500ms|</p>
<p>In this case, accuracy and running time are the evaluation matrices. Accuracy is the optimizing metric, because you want the classifier to correctly detect a cat image as accurately as possible. The running time which is set to be under 100 ms in this example, is the satisficing metric which mean that the metric has to meet expectation set.</p>
<p>The general rule is:<br>$$N_{metric}:\cases{1 &amp; \text{Optimizing metric} \ N_{metric}-1 &amp; \text{Satisficing metric}}$$</p>
<h3 id="03-train-dev-test-distributions"><a href="#03-train-dev-test-distributions" class="headerlink" title="03_train-dev-test-distributions"></a>03_train-dev-test-distributions</h3><p><strong>The way you set up your training dev, or development sets and test sets, can have a huge impact on how rapidly you or your team can make progress on building machine learning application. The same teams, even teams in very large companies, set up hese data sets in ways that really slows down, rather than speeds up, the progress of the team.</strong> Let’s take a look at how you can set up these data sets to maximize your team’s efficiency. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/9.png" alt=""><br>In this video, I want to focus on how you set up your <strong>dev and test sets</strong>. So, that dev set is also called <strong>the development set</strong>, or sometimes called the <strong>hold out cross validation set</strong>. And, workflow in machine learning is that you try a lot of ideas, train up different models on the training set, and then use the dev set to evaluate the different ideas and pick one. And, keep innovating to improve dev set performance until, finally, you have one clause that you’re happy with that you then evaluate on your test set. Now, let’s say, by way of example, that you’re building a cat crossfire, and you are operating in these regions: in the U.S, U.K, other European countries, South America, India, China, other Asian countries, and Australia. So, how do you set up your dev set and your test set? Well, one way you could do so is to pick four of these regions. I’m going to use these four but it could be four randomly chosen regions. And say, that data from these four regions will go into the dev set. And, the other four regions, I’m going to use these four, could be randomly chosen four as well, that those will go into the test set. It turns out, this is a very bad idea because in this example, your dev and test sets come from different distributions. <strong>I would, instead, recommend that you find a way to make your dev and test sets come from the same distribution. So, here’s what I mean. One picture to keep in mind is that, I think, setting up your dev set, plus, your single role number evaluation metric</strong>, that’s like placing a target and telling your team where you think is the bull’s eye you want to aim at. <strong>Because, what happen once you’ve established that dev set and the metric is that, the team can innovate very quickly, try different ideas, run experiments and very quickly use the dev set and the metric to evaluate classifier and try to pick the best one</strong>. So, machine learning teams are often very good at shooting different arrows into targets and innovating to get closer and closer to hitting the bullseye. So, doing well on your metric on your dev sets. And, the problem with how we’ve set up the dev and test sets in the example on the left is that, your team might spend months innovating to do well on the dev set only to realize that, when you finally go to test them on the test set, that data from these four countries or these four regions at the bottom, might be very different than the regions in your dev set. So, you might have a nasty surprise and realize that, all the months of work you spent optimizing to the dev set, is not giving you good performance on the test set. So, having dev and test sets from different distributions is like setting a target, having your team spend months trying to aim closer and closer to bull’s eye, only to realize after months of work that, you’ll say, “Oh wait, to test it, I’m going to move target over here.” And, the team might say, “Well, why did you make us spend months optimizing for a different bull’s eye when suddenly, you can move the bull’s eye to a different location somewhere else?” So, to avoid this, what I recommend instead is that, you take all this randomly shuffled data into the dev and test set. So that, both the dev and test sets have data from all eight regions and that <strong>the dev and test sets really come from the same distribution, which is the distribution of all of your data mixed together</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/10.png" alt=""><br>Here’s another example. This is a, actually, true story but with some details changed. So, I know a machine learning team that actually spent several months optimizing on a dev set which was comprised of loan approvals for medium income zip codes. So, the specific machine learning problem was, “Given an input X about a loan application, can you predict why and which is, whether or not, they’ll repay the loan?” So, this helps you decide whether or not to approve a loan. And so, the dev set came from loan applications. They came from medium income zip codes. Zip codes is what we call postal codes in the United States. But, after working on this for a few months, the team then, suddenly decided to test this on data from low income zip codes or low income postal codes. And, of course, the distributional data for medium income and low income zip codes is very different. And, the crossfire, that they spend so much time optimizing in the former case, just didn’t work well at all on the latter case. And so, this particular team actually wasted about three months of time and had to go back and really re-do a lot of work. And, what happened here was, the team spent three months aiming for one target, and then, after three months, the manager asked, “Oh, how are you doing on hitting this other target?” This is a totally different location. And, it just was a very frustrating experience for the team. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/11.png" alt=""><br>So, what I recommand for setting up a dev set and test set is, choose a dev set and test set to reflect data you expect to get in future and consider important to do well on. And, in particular, the dev set and the test set here, should come from the same distribution. So, whatever type of data you expect to get in the future, and once you do well on, try to get data that looks like that. And, whatever that data is, put it into both your dev set and your test set. Because that way, you’re putting the target where you actually want to hit and you’re having the team innovate very efficiently to hitting that same target, hopefully, the same targets well. Since we haven’t talked yet about how to set up a training set, we’ll talk about the training set in a later video. But, the important take away from this video is that, setting up the dev set, as well as the validation metric, is really defining what target you want to aim at. And hopefully, by setting the dev set and the test set to the same distribution, you’re really aiming at whatever target you hope your machine learning team will hit. <strong>The way you choose your training set will affect how well you can actually hit that target</strong>. But, we can talk about that separately in a later video. </p>
<p>So, I know some machine learning teams that could literally have saved themselves months of work could they follow the guidelines in this video. So, I hope these guidelines will help you, too. Next, it turns out, that the size of your dev and test sets, how to choose the size of them, is also changing the area of deep learning. Let’s talk about that in the next video.</p>
<h4 id="summary-1"><a href="#summary-1" class="headerlink" title="summary"></a>summary</h4><p><strong>Training, development and test distributions</strong></p>
<p>Setting up the training, development and test sets have a huge impact on productivity. It is important to choose the development and test sets from the same distribution and it must be taken randomly from all the data.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline</strong></p>
<p>Choose a development set and test set to reflect data you expect to get in the future and consider important to do well.</p>
<h3 id="04-size-of-the-dev-and-test-sets"><a href="#04-size-of-the-dev-and-test-sets" class="headerlink" title="04_size-of-the-dev-and-test-sets"></a>04_size-of-the-dev-and-test-sets</h3><p>In the last video, you saw how your dev and test sets should come from the same distribution, but how long should they be? The guidelines to help set up your dev and test sets are changing in the Deep Learning era. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/12.png" alt=""><br>Let’s take a look at some best practices. You might have heard of the rule of thumb in machine learning of taking all the data you have and using a 70/30 split into a train and test set, or have you had to set up train dev and test sets maybe, you would use a 60% training and 20% dev and 20% tests. <strong>In earlier eras of machine learning, this was pretty reasonable, especially back when data set sizes were just smaller.</strong> So if you had a hundred examples in total, these 70/30 or 60/20/20 rule of thumb would be pretty reasonable. If you had thousand examples, maybe if you had ten thousand examples, these things are not unreasonable. But in the modern machine learning era, we are now used to working with much larger data set sizes. So let’s say you have a million training examples, it might be quite reasonable to set up your data so that you have 98% in the training set, 1% dev, and 1% test. And when you use DNT to abbreviate dev and test sets. Because if you have a million examples, then 1% of that, is 10,000 examples, and that might be plenty enough for a dev set or for a test set. So, in the modern Deep Learning era where sometimes we have much larger data sets, It’s quite reasonable to use a much smaller than 20 or 30% of your data for a dev set or a test set. And because Deep Learning algorithms have such a huge hunger for data, I’m seeing that, the problems we have large data sets that have much larger fraction of it goes into the training set. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/13.png" alt=""><br>So, how about the test set? Remember the purpose of your test set is that, after you finish developing a system, the test set helps evaluate how good your final system is. The guideline is, to set your test set to big enough to give high confidence in the overall performance of your system. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/14.png" alt=""><br>So, unless you need to have a very accurate measure of how well your final system is performing, maybe you don’t need millions and millions of examples in a test set, and maybe for your application if you think that having 10,000 examples gives you enough confidence to find the performance on maybe 100,000 or whatever it is, that might be enough. And this could be much less than, say 30% of the overall data set, depend on how much data you have. For some applications, maybe you don’t need a high confidence in the overall performance of your final system. Maybe all you need is a train and dev set, And I think, not having a test set might be okay. In fact, what sometimes happened was, people were talking about using train test splits but what they were actually doing was iterating on the test set. So rather than test set, what they had was a train dev split and no test set. If you’re actually tuning to this set, to this dev set and this test set, It’s better to call the dev set. Although I think in the history of machine learning, not everyone has been completely clean and completely records of about calling the dev set when it really should be treated as test set. But, if all you care about is having some data that you train on, and having some data to tune to, and you’re just going to shake the final system and not worry too much about how it was actually doing, I think it will be healthy and just call the train dev set and acknowledge that you have no test set. This a bit unusual? I’m definitely not recommending not having a test set when building a system. I do find it reassuring to have a separate test set you can use to get an unbiased estimate of how I was doing before you shift it, but if you have a very large dev set so that you think you won’t overfit the dev set too badly. Maybe it’s not totally unreasonable to just have a train dev set, although it’s not what I usually recommend. </p>
<p>So to summarize, in the era of big data, I think the old rule of thumb of a 70/30 is that, that no longer applies. And the trend has been to use more data for training and less for dev and test, especially when you have a very large data sets. And the rule of thumb is really to try to set the dev set to big enough for its purpose, which helps you evaluate different ideas and pick this up from AOP better. And the purpose of test set is to help you evaluate your final cost buys. You just have to set your test set big enough for that purpose, and that could be much less than 30% of the data. So, I hope that gives some guidance or some suggestions on how to set up your dev and test sets in the Deep Learning era. Next, it turns out that sometimes, part way through a machine learning problem, you might want to change your evaluation metric, or change your dev and test sets. Let’s talk about it when you might want to do.</p>
<h4 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h4><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/15.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="05-when-to-change-dev-test-sets-and-metrics"><a href="#05-when-to-change-dev-test-sets-and-metrics" class="headerlink" title="05_when-to-change-dev-test-sets-and-metrics"></a>05_when-to-change-dev-test-sets-and-metrics</h3><p>You’ve seen how sets of a dev set and evaluation metric is like placing a target somewhere for your team to aim at. But sometimes partway through a project you might realize you put your target in the wrong place. In that case you should move your target. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/16.png" alt=""><br>Let’s take a look at an example. Let’s say you build a cat classifier to try to find lots of pictures of cats to show to your cat loving users and the metric that you decided to use is classification error. So algorithms A and B have, respectively, 3 percent error and 5 percent error, so <strong>it seems like Algorithm A is doing better</strong>. But let’s say you try out these algorithms, you look at these algorithms and <strong>Algorithm A, for some reason, is letting through a lot of the pornographic images</strong>. So if you shift Algorithm A the users would see more cat images because you’ll see 3 percent error and identify cats, but it also shows the users some pornographic images which is totally unacceptable both for your company, as well as for your users. <strong>In contrast, Algorithm B has 5 percent error so this classifies fewer images but it doesn’t have pornographic images</strong>. So from your company’s point of view, as well as from a user acceptance point of view, <strong>Algorithm B is actually a much better algorithm because it’s not letting through any pornographic images</strong>. So, what has happened in this example is that Algorithm A is doing better on evaluation metric. It’s getting 3 percent error but it is actually a worse algorithm. <strong>In this case, the evaluation metric plus the dev set prefers Algorithm A because they’re saying, look, Algorithm A has lower error which is the metric you’re using but you and your users prefer Algorithm B because it’s not letting through pornographic images. So when this happens, when your evaluation metric is no longer correctly rank ordering preferences between algorithms, in this case is mispredicting that Algorithm A is a better algorithm, then that’s a sign that you should change your evaluation metric or perhaps your development set or test set.</strong> In this case the misclassification error metric that you’re using can be written as follows: this one over m, a number of examples in your development set, of sum from i equals 1 to mdev, number of examples in this development set of indicator of whether or not the prediction of example i in your development set is not equal to the actual label i, where they use this notation to denote their predictive value. Right. So these are zero. And this, $I\left{\right}$ , indicates a function notation, counts up the number of examples on which this thing inside it’s true. So this formula just counts up the number of misclassified examples. The problem with this evaluation metric is that they treat pornographic and non-pornographic images equally but you really want your classifier to not mislabel pornographic images, like maybe you recognize a pornographic image in cat image and therefore show it to unsuspecting user, therefore very unhappy with unexpectedly seeing porn. One way to change this evaluation metric would be if you add the weight term here, we call this w(i) where w(i) is going to be equal to 1 if x(i) is non-porn and maybe 10 or maybe even large number like a 100 if x(i) is porn. So this way you’re giving a much larger weight to examples that are pornographic so that the error term goes up much more if the algorithm makes a mistake on classifying a pornographic image as a cat image. In this example you giving 10 times bigger weights to classify pornographic images correctly. If you want this normalization constant, technically this becomes sum over i of w(i), so then this error would still be between zero and one. The details of this weighting aren’t important and actually to implement this weighting, you need to actually go through your dev and test sets, so label the pornographic images in your dev and test sets so you can implement this weighting function. <strong>But the high level of take away is, if you find that evaluation metric is not giving the correct rank order preference for what is actually better algorithm, then there’s a time to think about defining a new evaluation metric. And this is just one possible way that you could define an evaluation metric. The goal of the evaluation metric is accurately tell you, given two classifiers, which one is better for your application. For the purpose of this video, don’t worry too much about the details of how we define a new error metric, the point is that if you’re not satisfied with your old error metric then don’t keep coasting with an error metric you’re unsatisfied with, instead try to define a new one that you think better captures your preferences in terms of what’s actually a better algorithm.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/17.png" alt=""><br>One thing you might notice is that so far we’ve only talked about how to define a metric to evaluate classifiers. That is, we’ve defined an evaluation metric that helps us better rank order classifiers when they are performing at varying levels in terms of streaming of porn. <strong>And this is actually an example of an orthogonalization where I think you should take a machine learning problem and break it into distinct steps</strong>. One step is to figure out how to define a metric that captures what you want to do, and I would worry separately about how to actually do well on this metric. So think of the machine learning task as two distinct steps. To use the target analogy, the first step is to place the target. So define where you want to aim and then as a completely separate step, this is one you can tune which is how do you place the target as a completely separate problem. Think of it as a separate step to tune in terms of how to do well at this algorithm, how to aim accurately or how to shoot at the target. Defining the metric is step one and you do something else for step two. In terms of shooting at the target, maybe your learning algorithm is optimizing some cost function that looks like this, where you are minimizing some of losses on your training set. One thing you could do is to also modify this in order to incorporate these weights and maybe end up changing this normalization constant as well. So it just 1 over a sum of w(i). Again, the details of how you define J aren’t important, but <strong>the point was with the philosophy of orthogonalization think of placing the target as one step and aiming and shooting at a target as a distinct step which you do separately. In other words I encourage you to think of, defining the metric as one step and only after you define a metric, figure out how to do well on that metric which might be changing the cost function J that your neural network is optimizing.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/18.png" alt=""><br>Before going on, let’s look at just one more example. Let’s say that your two cat classifiers A and B have, respectively, 3 percent error and 5 percent error as evaluated on your dev set. Or maybe even on your test set which are images downloaded off the internet, so high quality well framed images. But maybe when you deploy your algorithm product, you find that algorithm B actually looks like it’s performing better, even though it’s doing better on your dev set. And you find that you’ve been training off very nice high quality images downloaded off the Internet but when you deploy those on the mobile app, users are uploading all sorts of pictures, they’re much less framed, you haven’t only covered the cat, the cats have funny facial expressions, maybe images are much blurrier, and when you test out your algorithms you find that Algorithm B is actually doing better. So this would be another example of your metric and dev test sets falling down. The problem is that you’re evaluating on the dev and test sets a very nice, high resolution, well-framed images but what your users really care about is you have them doing well on images they are uploading, which are maybe less professional shots and blurrier and less well framed. So the guideline is, if doing well on your metric and your current dev sets or dev and test sets’ distribution, if that does not correspond to doing well on the application you actually care about, then change your metric and your dev test set. In other words, if we discover that your dev test set has these very high quality images but evaluating on this dev test set is not predictive of how well your app actually performs, because your app needs to deal with lower quality images, then that’s a good time to change your dev test set so that your data better reflects the type of data you actually need to do well on. But the overall guideline is if your current metric and data you are evaluating on doesn’t correspond to doing well on what you actually care about, then change your metrics and/or your dev/test set to better capture what you need your algorithm to actually do well on. </p>
<p>Having an evaluation metric and the dev set allows you to much more quickly make decisions about is Algorithm A or Algorithm B better. It really speeds up how quickly you and your team can iterate. <strong>So my recommendation is, even if you can’t define the perfect evaluation metric and dev set, just set something up quickly and use that to drive the speed of your team iterating. And if later down the line you find out that it wasn’t a good one, you have better idea, change it at that time, it’s perfectly okay. But what I recommend against for the most teams is to run for too long without any evaluation metric and dev set up because that can slow down the efficiency of what your team can iterate and improve your algorithm</strong>. So that says on when to change your evaluation metric and/or dev and test sets. I hope that these guidelines help you set up your whole team to have a well-defined target that you can iterate efficiently towards improving performance.</p>
<h3 id="summary-2"><a href="#summary-2" class="headerlink" title="summary"></a>summary</h3><p><strong>When to change development/test sets and metrics</strong></p>

<p>It seems that Algorithm A is better than Algorithm B since there is only a 3% error, however for some reason, Algorithm A is letting through a lot of the pornographic images. </p>
<p>Algorithm B has 5% error thus it classifies fewer images but it doesn’t have pornographic images. From a company’s point of view, as well as from a user acceptance point of view, Algorithm B is actually a better algorithm. The evaluation metric fails to correctly rank order preferences between algorithms. The evaluation metric or the development set or test set should be changed. </p>
<p>The misclassification error metric can be written as a function as follow:</p>
<p>$$Error:\frac{1}{m_{dev}}\sum\limits^{m_{dev}}_{i=1}\mathcal{L}{\hat{y}^{(i)}\ne y^{(i)}}$$</p>
<p>This function counts up the number of misclassified examples.</p>
<p>The problem with this evaluation metric is that it treats pornographic vs non-pornographic images equally. On way to change this evaluation metric is to add the weight term $w^{(i)}$</p>
<p>$$W^{(i)}=\cases{1 &amp; \text{if x^{(i)} is non-porngraphic} \ 10 &amp; \text{if x^{(i)} is porngraphic} }$$</p>

Why is this? I think there are two main reasons</strong>. <strong>First</strong> is that because of advances in deep learning, machine learning algorithms are suddenly working much better and so it has become much more feasible in a lot of application areas for machine learning algorithms to actually become competitive with human-level performance. <strong>Second</strong>, it turns out that the workflow of designing and building a machine learning system, the workflow is much more efficient when you’re trying to do something that humans can also do. So in those settings, it becomes natural to talk about comparing, or trying to mimic human-level performance. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/19.png" alt=""><br>Let’s see a couple examples of what this means. I’ve seen on a lot of machine learning tasks that as you work on a problem over time, so the x-axis, time, this could be many months or even many years over which some team or some research community is working on a problem. Progress tends to be relatively rapid as you approach human level performance. But then after a while, the algorithm surpasses human-level performance and then progress and accuracy actually slows down. And maybe it keeps getting better but after surpassing human level performance it can still get better, but performance, the slope of how rapid the accuracy’s going up, often that slows down. And the hope is it achieves some theoretical optimum level of performance. And over time, as you keep training the algorithm, maybe bigger and bigger models on more and more data, the performance approaches but never surpasses some theoretical limit, which is called the Bayes optimal error. So Bayes optimal error, think of this as the best possible error. And that’s just the way for any function mapping from x to y to surpass a certain level of accuracy. So for example, for speech recognition, if x is audio clips, some audio is just so noisy it is impossible to tell what is in the correct transcription. So the perfect error may not be 100%. Or for cat recognition. Maybe some images are so blurry, that it is just impossible for anyone or anything to tell whether or not there’s a cat in that picture. So, the perfect level of accuracy may not be 100%. And Bayes optimal error, or Bayesian optimal error, or sometimes Bayes error for short, is the very best theoretical function for mapping from x to y. That can never be surpassed. So it should be no surprise that this purple line, no matter how many years you work on a problem you can never surpass Bayes error, Bayes optimal error. And it turns out that progress is often quite fast until you surpass human level performance. And it sometimes slows down after you surpass human level performance. And I think there are two reasons for that, for why progress often slows down when you surpass human level performance. One reason is that human level performance is for many tasks not that far from Bayes’ optimal error. People are very good at looking at images and telling if there’s a cat or listening to audio and transcribing it. So, by the time you surpass human level performance maybe there’s not that much head room to still improve. But the second reason is that so long as your performance is worse than human level performance, then there are actually certain tools you could use to improve performance that are harder to use once you’ve surpassed human level performance. So here’s what I mean. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/21.png" alt=""><br>For tasks that humans are quite good at, and this includes looking at pictures and recognizing things, or listening to audio, or reading language, really natural data tasks humans tend to be very good at. For tasks that humans are good at, so long as your machine learning algorithm is still worse than the human, you can get labeled data from humans. That is you can ask people, ask higher humans, to label examples for you so that you can have more data to feed your learning algorithm. Something we’ll talk about next week is manual error analysis. But so long as humans are still performing better than any other algorithm, you can ask people to look at examples that your algorithm’s getting wrong, and try to gain insight in terms of why a person got it right but the algorithm got it wrong. And we’ll see next week that this helps improve your algorithm’s performance. And you can also get a better analysis of bias and variance which we’ll talk about in a little bit. But so long as your algorithm is still doing worse then humans you have these important tactics for improving your algorithm. Whereas once your algorithm is doing better than humans, then these three tactics are harder to apply. So, this is maybe another reason why comparing to human level performance is helpful, especially on tasks that humans do well. And why machine learning algorithms tend to be really good at trying to replicate tasks that people can do and kind of catch up and maybe slightly surpass human level performance. </p>
<p>In particular, even though you know what is bias and what is variance it turns out that knowing how well humans can do on a task can help you understand better how much you should try to reduce bias and how much you should try to reduce variance. I want to show you an example of this in the next video. </p>
<h4 id="summary-3"><a href="#summary-3" class="headerlink" title="summary"></a>summary</h4><p><strong>Why human-level performance?</strong></p>
<p>Today, machine learning algorithms can compete with human-level performance since they are more productive and more feasible in a lot of application. Also, the workflow of designing and building a machine learning system, is much more efficient than before. </p>
<p>Moreover, some of the tasks that humans do are close to “perfection”, which is why machine learning tries to mimic human-level performance. </p>
<p>The graph below shows the performance of humans and machine learning over time.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/22.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Machine learning progresses slowly when it surpasses human-level performance. One of the reason is that human-level performance can be close to Bayes optimal error, especially for natural perception problem.</p>
<p>Bayes optimal error is defined as the best possible error. In other words, it means that any functions mapping from x to y can’t surpass a certain level of accuracy.</p>
<p>Also, when the performance of machine learning is worse than the performance of humans, you can improve it with different tools. They are harder to use once its surpasses human-level performance.</p>
<p>These tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get labeled data from humans</li>
<li>Gain insight from manual error analysis: Why did a person get this right?</li>
<li>Better analysis of bias/variance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="02-avoidable-bias"><a href="#02-avoidable-bias" class="headerlink" title="02_avoidable-bias"></a>02_avoidable-bias</h3><p>We talked about how you want your learning algorithm to do well on the training set but sometimes you don’t actually want to do too well and knowing what human level performance is, can tell you exactly how well but not too well you want your algorithm to do on the training set. Let me show you what I mean. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/23.png" alt=""><br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/24.png" alt=""><br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/25.png" alt=""><br>We have used Cat classification a lot and given a picture, let’s say humans have near-perfect accuracy so the human level error is one percent. In that case, if your learning algorithm achieves 8 percent training error and 10 percent dev error, then maybe you wanted to do better on the training set. So the fact that there’s a huge gap between how well your algorithm does on your training set versus how humans do shows that your algorithm isn’t even fitting the training set well. So in terms of tools to reduce <strong>bias or variance</strong>, in this case I would say focus on reducing bias. So you want to do things like train a bigger neural network or run training set longer, just try to do better on the training set. But now let’s look at the same training error and dev error and imagine that human level performance was not 1%. So this copy is over but you know in a different application or maybe on a different data set, let’s say that human level error is actually 7.5%. Maybe the images in your data set are so blurry that even humans can’t tell whether there’s a cat in this picture. This example is maybe slightly contrived because humans are actually very good at looking at pictures and telling if there’s a cat in it or not. But for the sake of this example, let’s say your data sets images are so blurry or so low resolution that even humans get 7.5% error. In this case, even though your training error and dev error are the same as the other example, you see that maybe you’re actually doing just fine on the training set. It’s doing only a little bit worse than human level performance. And in this second example, you would maybe want to focus on reducing this component, reducing the variance in your learning algorithm. So you might try regularization to try to bring your dev error closer to your training error for example. So in the earlier courses discussion on bias and variance, we were mainly assuming that there were tasks where Bayes error is nearly zero. So to explain what just happened here, for our Cat classification example, think of human level error as a proxy or as a estimate for Bayes error or for Bayes optimal error. And for computer vision tasks, this is a pretty reasonable proxy because humans are actually very good at computer vision and so whatever a human can do is maybe not too far from Bayes error. By definition, human level error is worse than Bayes error because nothing could be better than Bayes error but human level error might not be too far from Bayes error. So the surprising thing we saw here is that depending on what human level error is or really this is really approximately Bayes error or so we assume it to be, but depending on what we think is achievable, with the same training error and dev error in these two cases, we decided to focus on bias reduction tactics or on variance reduction tactics. And what happened is in the example on the left, 8% training error is really high when you think you could get it down to 1% and so bias reduction tactics could help you do that. Whereas in the example on the right, if you think that Bayes error is 7.5% and here we’re using human level error as an estimate or as a proxy for Bayes error, but you think that Bayes error is close to seven point five percent then you know there’s not that much headroom for reducing your training error further down. You don’t really want it to be that much better than 7.5% because you could achieve that only by maybe starting to offer further training so, and instead, there’s much more room for improvement in terms of taking this 2% gap and trying to reduce that by using variance reduction techniques such as regularization or maybe getting more training data. So to give these things a couple of names, this is not widely used terminology but I found this useful terminology and a useful way of thinking about it, which is I’m going to call the difference between Bayes error or approximation of Bayes error and the training error to be <strong>the avoidable bias</strong>. So what you want is maybe keep improving your training performance until you get down to Bayes error but you don’t actually want to do better than Bayes error. You can’t actually do better than Bayes error unless you’re overfitting. And this, the difference between your training area and the dev error, there’s a measure still of the variance problem of your algorithm. And the term avoidable bias acknowledges that there’s some bias or some minimum level of error that you just cannot get below which is that if Bayes error is 7.5%, you don’t actually want to get below that level of error. So rather than saying that if you’re training error is 8%, then the 8% is a measure of bias in this example, you’re saying that the avoidable bias is maybe 0.5% or 0.5% is a measure of the avoidable bias whereas 2% is a measure of the variance and so there’s much more room in reducing this 2% than in reducing this 0.5%. Whereas in contrast in the example on the left, this 7% is a measure of the avoidable bias, whereas 2% is a measure of how much variance you have. And so in this example on the left, there’s much more potential in focusing on reducing that avoidable bias. </p>
<p>So in this example, understanding human level error, understanding your estimate of Bayes error really causes you in different scenarios to focus on different tactics, whether bias avoidance tactics or variance avoidance tactics. There’s quite a lot more nuance in how you factor in human level performance into how you make decisions in choosing what to focus on. Thus in the next video, go deeper into understanding of what human level performance really mean.</p>
<h4 id="summary-4"><a href="#summary-4" class="headerlink" title="summary"></a>summary</h4><p><strong>Avoidable bias</strong><br>By knowing what the human-level performance is, it is possible to tell when a training set is performing well or not.</p>
<p><strong>Example: Cat vs Non-Cat</strong><br>In this case, the human level error as a proxy for Bayes error since humans are good to identify images. If you want to improve the performance of the training set but you can’t do better than the Bayes error otherwise the training set is overfitting. By knowing the Bayes error, it is easier to focus on whether bias or variance avoidance tactics will improve the performance of the model.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/26.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Scenario A</strong><br>There is a 7% gap between the performance of the training set and the human level error. It means that the algorithm isn’t fitting well with the training set since the target is around 1%. To resolve the issue, we use bias reduction technique such as training a bigger neural network or running the training set longer.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario B</strong><br>The training set is doing good since there is only a 0.5% difference with the human level error. The difference between the training set and the human level error is called avoidable bias. The focus here is to reduce the variance since the difference between the training error and the development error is 2%. To resolve the issue, we use variance reduction technique such as regularization or have a bigger training set.</p>
<h3 id="03-understanding-human-level-performance"><a href="#03-understanding-human-level-performance" class="headerlink" title="03_understanding-human-level-performance"></a>03_understanding-human-level-performance</h3><p>The term human-level performance is sometimes used casually in research articles. But let me show you how we can define it a bit more precisely. And in particular, use the definition of the phrase, human-level performance, that is most useful for helping you drive progress in your machine learning project. </p>
<p>So remember from our last video that one of the uses of this phrase, human-level error, is that it gives us a way of estimating Bayes error. What is the best possible error any function could, either now or in the future, ever, ever achieve? So bearing that in mind, let’s look at a medical image classification example.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/27.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say that you want to look at a radiology image like this, and make a diagnosis classification decision. And suppose that a typical human, untrained human, achieves 3% error on this task. A typical doctor, maybe a typical radiologist doctor, achieves 1% error. An experienced doctor does even better, 0.7% error. And a team of experienced doctors, that is if you get a team of experienced doctors and have them all look at the image and discuss and debate the image, together their consensus opinion achieves 0.5% error. So the question I want to pose to you is, how should you define human-level error? Is human-level error 3%, 1%, 0.7% or 0.5%? Feel free to pause this video to think about it if you wish. And to answer that question, I would urge you to bear in mind that one of the most useful ways to think of human error is as a proxy or an estimate for Bayes error. So please feel free to pause this video to think about it for a while if you wish. <strong>But here’s how I would define human-level error. Which is if you want a proxy or an estimate for Bayes error, then given that a team of experienced doctors discussing and debating can achieve 0.5% error, we know that Bayes error is less than equal to 0.5%. So because some system, team of these doctors can achieve 0.5% error, so by definition, this directly, optimal error has got to be 0.5% or lower. We don’t know how much better it is, maybe there’s a even larger team of even more experienced doctors who could do even better, so maybe it’s even a little bit better than 0.5%. But we know the optimal error cannot be higher than 0.5%. So what I would do in this setting is use 0.5% as our estimate for Bayes error. So I would define human-level performance as 0.5%. At least if you’re hoping to use human-level error in the analysis of bias and variance as we saw in the last video.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Now, for the purpose of publishing a research paper or for the purpose of deploying a system, maybe there’s a different definition of human-level error</strong> that you can use which is so long as you surpass the performance of a typical doctor. That seems like maybe a very useful result if accomplished, and maybe surpassing a single radiologist, a single doctor’s performance might mean the system is good enough to deploy in some context. So maybe the takeaway from this is to be clear about what your purpose is in defining the term human-level error. And if it is to show that you can surpass a single human and therefore argue for deploying your system in some context, maybe this is the appropriate definition. <strong>But if your goal is the proxy for Bayes error, then this is the appropriate definition.</strong> To see why this matters, let’s look at an error analysis example. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/28.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say, for a medical imaging diagnosis example, that your training error is 5% and your dev error is 6%. And in the example from the previous slide, our human-level performance, and I’m going to think of this as proxy for Bayes error. Depending on whether you defined it as a typical doctor’s performance or experienced doctor or team of doctors, you would have either 1% or 0.7% or 0.5% for this. And remember also our definitions from the previous video, that this gap between Bayes error or estimate of Bayes error and training error is calling that a measure of the avoidable bias. And this as a measure or an estimate of how much of a variance problem you have in your learning algorithm. So in this first example, whichever of these choices you make, the measure of avoidable bias will be something like 4%. It will be somewhere between I guess, 4%, if you take that to 4.5%, if you use 0.5%, whereas this is 1%. So in this example, I would say, it doesn’t really matter which of the definitions of human-level error you use, whether you use the typical doctor’s error or the single experienced doctor’s error or the team of experienced doctor’s error. Whether this is 4% or 4.5%, this is clearly bigger than the variance problem. And so in this case, you should focus on bias reduction techniques such as train a bigger network. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/29.png" alt=""><br>Now let’s look at a second example. Let’s see your training error is 1% and your dev error is 5%. Then again it doesn’t really matter, seems but academic whether the human-level performance is 1% or 0.7% or 0.5%. Because whichever of these definitions you use, your measure of avoidable bias will be, I guess somewhere between 0% if you use that, to 0.5%, right? That’s the gap between the human-level performance and your training error, whereas this gap is 4%. So this 4% is going to be much bigger than the avoidable bias either way. And so they’ll just suggest you should focus on variance reduction techniques such as regularization or getting a bigger training set. </p>
<p>But where it really matters will be if your training error is 0.7%. So you’re doing really well now, and your dev error is 0.8%. In this case, it really matters that you use your estimate for Bayes error as 0.5%. Because in this case, your measure of how much avoidable bias you have is 0.2% which is twice as big as your measure for your variance, which is just 0.1%. And so this suggests that maybe both the bias and variance are both problems but maybe the avoidable bias is a bit bigger of a problem. And in this example, 0.5% as we discussed on the previous slide was the best measure of Bayes error, because a team of human doctors could achieve that performance. If you use 0.7 as your proxy for Bayes error, you would have estimated avoidable bias as pretty much 0%, and you might have missed that. You actually should try to do better on your training set. So I hope this gives a sense also of why making progress in a machine learning problem gets harder as you achieve or as you approach human-level performance. In this example, once you’ve approached 0.7% error, unless you’re very careful about estimating Bayes error, you might not know how far away you are from Bayes error. And therefore how much you should be trying to reduce aviodable bias. In fact, if all you knew was that a single typical doctor achieves 1% error, and it might be very difficult to know if you should be trying to fit your training set even better. And this problem arose only when you’re doing very well on your problem already, only when you’re doing 0.7%, 0.8%, really close to human-level performance. Whereas in the two examples on the left, when you are further away human-level performance, it was easier to target your focus on bias or variance. So this is maybe an illustration of why as your pro human-level performance is actually harder to tease out the bias and variance effects. And therefore why progress on your machine learning project just gets harder as you’re doing really well. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/30.png" alt=""><br>So just to summarize what we’ve talked about. If you’re trying to understand bias and variance where you have an estimate of human-level error for a task that humans can do quite well, you can use human-level error as a proxy or as a approximation for Bayes error. And so the difference between your estimate of Bayes error tells you how much avoidable bias is a problem, how much avoidable bias there is. And the difference between training error and dev error, that tells you how much variance is a problem, whether your algorithm’s able to generalize from the training set to the dev set. And the big difference between our discussion here and what we saw in an earlier course was that instead of comparing training error to 0%, And just calling that the estimate of the bias. In contrast, in this video we have a more nuanced analysis in which there is no particular expectation that you should get 0% error. Because sometimes Bayes error is non zero and sometimes it’s just not possible for anything to do better than a certain threshold of error. And so in the earlier course, we were measuring training error, and seeing how much bigger training error was than zero. And just using that to try to understand how big our bias is. And that turns out to work just fine for problems where Bayes error is nearly 0%, such as recognizing cats. Humans are near perfect for that, so Bayes error is also near perfect for that. So that actually works okay when Bayes error is nearly zero. But for problems where the data is noisy, like speech recognition on very noisy audio where it’s just impossible sometimes to hear what was said and to get the correct transcription. For problems like that, having a better estimate for Bayes error can help you better estimate avoidable bias and variance. And therefore make better decisions on whether to focus on bias reduction tactics, or on variance reduction tactics. </p>
<p><strong>So to recap, having an estimate of human-level performance gives you an estimate of Bayes error. And this allows you to more quickly make decisions as to whether you should focus on trying to reduce a bias or trying to reduce the variance of your algorithm. And these techniques will tend to work well until you surpass human-level performance, whereupon you might no longer have a good estimate of Bayes error that still helps you make this decision really clearly. Now, one of the exciting developments in deep learning has been that for more and more tasks we’re actually able to surpass human-level performance.</strong> In the next video, let’s talk more about the process of surpassing human-level performance. </p>
<h4 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h4><p><strong>Understanding human-level performance</strong></p>
<p>Human-level error gives an estimate of Bayes error.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: Medical image classification</strong></p>
<p>This is an example of a medical image classification in which the input is a radiology image and the output is a diagnosis classification decision.</p>
<p>The definition of human-level error depends on the purpose of the analysis, in this case, by definition the Bayes error is lower or equal to 0.5%.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/35.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this case, the choice of human-level performance doesn’t have an impact. The avoidable bias is between 4%-4.5% and the variance is 1%. Therefore, the focus should be on bias reduction technique.</p>
<p>Scenario B</p>
<p>In this case, the choice of human-level performance doesn’t have an impact. The avoidable bias is between 0%-0.5% and the variance is 4%. Therefore, the focus should be on variance reduction technique.</p>
<p>Scenario C</p>
<p>In this case, the estimate for Bayes error has to be 0.5% since you can’t go lower than the human-level performance otherwise the training set is overfitting. Also, the avoidable bias is 0.2% and the variance is 0.1%. Therefore, the focus should be on bias reduction technique. Summary of bias/variance with human-level performance</p>

<h3 id="04-surpassing-human-level-performance"><a href="#04-surpassing-human-level-performance" class="headerlink" title="04_surpassing-human-level-performance"></a>04_surpassing-human-level-performance</h3><p>A lot of teams often find it exciting to surpass human-level performance on the specific recreational classification task. Let’s talk over some of the things you see if you try to accomplish this yourself. We’ve discussed before how machine learning progress gets harder as you approach or even surpass human-level performance. Let’s talk over one more example of why that’s the case. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/31.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say you have a problem where a team of humans discussing and debating achieves 0.5% error, a single human 1% error, and you have an algorithm of 0.6% training error and 0.8% dev error. So in this case, what is the avoidable bias? So this one is relatively easier to answer, 0.5% is your estimate of base error, so your avoidable bias is, you’re not going to use this 1% number as reference, you can use this difference, so maybe you estimate your avoidable bias is at least 0.1% and your variance as 0.2%. So there’s maybe more to do to reduce your variance than your avoidable bias perhaps. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/32.png" alt=""><br>But now let’s take <strong>a harder example</strong>, let’s say, a team of humans and single human performance, the same as before, but your algorithm gets 0.3% training error, and 0.4% dev error. Now, what is the avoidable bias? It’s now actually much harder to answer that. Is the fact that your training error, 0.3%, does this mean you’ve over-fitted by 0.2%, or is base error, actually 0.1%, or maybe is base error 0.2%, or maybe base error is 0.3%? You don’t really know, <strong>but based on the information given in this example, you actually don’t have enough information to tell if you should focus on reducing bias or reducing variance in your algorithm. So that slows down the efficiency where you should make progress. Moreover, if your error is already better than even a team of humans looking at and discussing and debating the right label, for an example, then it’s just also harder to rely on human intuition to tell your algorithm what are ways that your algorithm could still improve the performance</strong>? So in this example, once you’ve surpassed this 0.5% threshold, your options, your ways of making progress on the machine learning problem are just less clear. <strong>It doesn’t mean you can’t make progress, you might still be able to make significant progress, but some of the tools you have for pointing you in a clear direction just don’t work as well</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/33.png" alt=""><br>Now, there are many problems where machine learning significantly surpasses human-level performance. For example, I think, <strong>online advertising</strong>, estimating how likely someone is to click on that. Probably, learning algorithms do that much better today than any human could, or <strong>making product recommendations</strong>, recommending movies or books to you. I think that web sites today can do that much better than maybe even your closest friends can. All <strong>logistics predicting</strong> how long will take you to drive from A to B or predicting how long to take a delivery vehicle to drive from A to B, or trying to predict whether someone will repay a loan, and therefore, whether or not you should <strong>approve a loan offer</strong>. All of these are problems where I think today machine learning far surpasses a single human’s performance. Notice something about these four examples. <strong>All four of these examples are actually learning from structured data, where you might have a database of what has users clicked on, database of proper support for, databases of how long it takes to get from A to B, database of previous loan applications and their outcomes. And these are not natural perception problems, so these are not computer vision, or speech recognition, or natural language processing task. Humans tend to be very good in natural perception task. So it is possible, but it’s just a bit harder for computers to surpass human-level performance on natural perception task. And finally, all of these are problems where there are teams that have access to huge amounts of data</strong>. So for example, the best systems for all four of these applications have probably looked at far more data of that application than any human could possibly look at. And so, that’s also made it relatively easy for a computer to surpass human-level performance. <strong>Now, the fact that there’s so much data that computer could examine, so it can petrifies that’s called patterns than even the human mind.</strong> Other than these problems, today there are speech recognition systems that can surpass human-level performance. <strong>And there are also some computer vision, some image recognition tasks, where computers have surpassed human-level performance</strong>. But because humans are very good at this natural perception task, I think it was harder for computers to get there. And then there are some <strong>medical tasks</strong>, for example, <strong>reading ECGs or diagnosing skin cancer</strong>, or <strong>certain narrow radiology task</strong>, where computers are getting really good and maybe surpassing a single human-level performance. And I guess one of the exciting things about recent advances in deep learning is that even for these tasks we can now surpass human-level performance in some cases, <strong>but it has been a bit harder because humans tend to be very good at this natural perception task.</strong> </p>
<p>So surpassing human-level performance is often not easy, but given enough data there’ve been lots of deep learning systems have surpassed human-level performance on a single supervisory problem. So that makes sense for an application you’re working on. I hope that maybe someday you manage to get your deep learning system to also surpass human-level performance.</p>

<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/38.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>So, I think getting a supervised learning algorithm to work well means fundamentally hoping or assuming that you can do two things. First</strong> is that you can fit the training set pretty well and you can think of this as roughly saying that you can achieve low avoidable bias. <strong>And the second</strong> thing you’re assuming can do well is that doing well in the training set generalizes pretty well to the dev set or the test set and this is sort of saying that variance is not too bad. <strong>And in the spirit of thought organization, what you see is that there’s a second set of knobs to fix the avoidable bias issues such as training a bigger network or training longer. And there’s a separate set of things you can use to address variance problems, such as regularization or getting more training data</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/01_ml-strategy-1/39.png" alt=""><br>So to summarize of the process seen in the last several videos, if you want to improve the performance of your machine on your system, I would recommend looking at the difference between your training error and your proxy for base error and this gives you a sense of the avoidable bias. In other words, just how much better do you think you should be trying to do on your training set and then look at the difference between your dev error and your training error as an estimate. So, it’s how much of a variance problem you have. In other words, how much harder you should be working to make your performance generalize from the training set to the desk set, that it wasn’t trained on explicitly? So to whatever extent you want to try to reduce avoidable bias, I would try to apply tactics like train a bigger model. So, you can just do better on your training sets or train longer. Use a better optimization algorithm such as. Adds momentum or RMS prop, or use a better algorithm like ADOM. Or one of the thing you could try is to just find a better new nether architecture or better said, hyperparameters and this could include everything from changing the activation functions or changing the number of layers or hidden do this. Although you do that, it would be in the direction of increasing the model size to China other models or other models architectures, such as the current neural network and competitive neural networks which we’ll see in later courses. Whether or not a new neural network architecture will fit your training set better is sometimes hard to tell in events, but sometimes you can get much better results with a better architecture. Next to the extent that you find out variance is a problem. Some of the many of the techniques you could try, then includes the following. You can try to get more data, because getting more data to train on could help you generalize better to dev set data that you didn’t see. You could try regularization. So this includes things like or dropout, or data augmentation which she talks about the in the previous course. Or once again, you can also try various neural network architecture, hyperparameters search to see if that can help you find a new architecture that is better suited for problem. </p>
<p>I think that this notion of bias or avoidable bias and there is one of those things that easily learned, but tough to master and we’re able to systematically find the concept from this week’s videos. You actually be much more efficient and much more systematic and much more strategic than a lot of machine learning teams in terms of how to systematically go by improving the performance of their machine learning system. So, that this week’s whole work will allow you to practice and exercise more your understanding of these concepts. Best of luck with this homework and I look forward to also seeing you in next week’s videos. Variances are further.</p>

<p>The two fundamental assumptions of supervised learning </p>
<p>There are <strong>2 fundamental assumptions</strong> of supervised learning. The <strong>first</strong> one is to have a low avoidable bias which means that the training set fits well. The <strong>second</strong> one is to have a low or acceptable variance which means that the training set performance generalizes well to the development set and test set.</p>
<p>If the difference between human-level error and the training error is bigger than the difference between the training error and the development error, the focus should be on bias reduction technique which are training a bigger model, training longer or change the neural networks architecture or try various hyperparameters search.</p>
<p>If the difference between training error and the development error is bigger than the difference between the human-level error and the training error, the focus should be on variance reduction technique which are bigger data set, regularization or change the neural networks architecture or try various hyperparameters search.</p>

<h2 id="01-mini-batch-gradient-descent"><a href="#01-mini-batch-gradient-descent" class="headerlink" title="01_mini-batch-gradient-descent"></a>01_mini-batch-gradient-descent</h2><p>Hello, and welcome back. In this week, you learn about optimization algorithms that will enable you to train your neural network much faster. You’ve heard me say before that applying machine learning is a highly empirical process, is highly iterative process. In which you just had to train a lot of models to find one that works really well. So, it really helps to really train models quickly. <strong>One thing that makes it more difficult is that Deep Learning does not work best in a regime of big data. We are able to train neural networks on a huge data set and training on a large data set is just slow.</strong> So, what you find is that having fast optimization algorithms, having good <strong>optimization algorithms</strong> can really speed up the efficiency of you and your team. So, let’s get started by talking about <strong>mini-batch gradient descent</strong>. </p>
<p>You’ve learned previously that vectorization allows you to efficiently compute on all m examples, that allows you to process your whole training set without an explicit formula. That’s why we would take our training examples and stack them into these huge matrix capsule Xs. X1, X2, X3, and then eventually it goes up to X, M training samples. And similarly for Y this is Y1 and Y2, Y3 and so on up to YM. So, the dimension of X was an X by M and this was 1 by M. Vectorization allows you to process all M examples relatively quickly if M is very large then it can still be slow. For example what if M was 5 million or 50 million or even bigger. With the implementation of gradient descent on your whole training set, what you have to do is, you have to process your entire training set before you take one little step of gradient descent. And then you have to process your entire training sets of five million training samples again before you take another little step of gradient descent. So, it turns out that you can get a faster algorithm if you let gradient descent start to make some progress even before you finish processing your entire, your giant training sets of 5 million examples. In particular, here’s what you can do. Let’s say that you split up your training set into smaller, little baby training sets and these baby training sets are called <strong>mini-batches</strong>. </p>
<p>And let’s say each of your baby training sets have just 1,000 examples each. So, you take X1 through X1,000 and you call that your first little baby training set, also call the mini-batch. And then you take home the next 1,000 examples. X1,001 through X2,000 and then X1,000 examples and come next one and so on. I’m going to introduce a new notation I’m going to call this X superscript with curly braces, 1 and I am going to call this, X superscript with curly braces, 2. Now, if you have 5 million training samples total and each of these little mini batches has a thousand examples, that means you have 5,000 of these because you know 5,000 times 1,000 equals 5 million. Altogether you would have 5,000 of these mini batches. So it ends with X superscript curly braces 5,000 and then similarly you do the same thing for Y. You would also split up your training data for Y accordingly. So, call that Y1 then this is Y1,001 through Y2,000. This is called, Y2 and so on until you have Y5,000.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/1.png" alt=""><br>Now, mini batch number T is going to be comprised of X, T and Y, T. And that is a thousand training samples with the corresponding input output pairs. Before moving on, just to make sure my notation is clear, we have previously used superscript round brackets I to index in the training set so X I, is the I training sample. We use superscript, square brackets L to index into the different layers of the neural network. So, ZL comes from the Z value, the L layer of the neural network and here we are introducing the curly brackets T to index into different mini batches. So, you have XT, YT and to check your understanding of these, what is the dimension of XT and YT? Well, X is an X by M. So, if X1 is a thousand training examples or the X values for a thousand examples, then this dimension should be MX by 1,000 and X2 should also be an X by 1,000 and so on. So, all of these should have dimension MX by 1,000 and these should have dimension 1 by 1,000. To explain the name of this algorithm, batch gradient descent, refers to the gradient descent algorithm we have been talking about previously. Where you process your entire training set all at the same time. And the name comes from viewing that as processing your entire batch of training samples all at the same time. I know it’s not a great name but that’s just what it’s called. Mini-batch gradient descent in contrast, refers to algorithm which we’ll talk about on the next slide and which you process is single mini batch XT, YT at the same time rather than processing your entire training set XY the same time. </p>
<p><strong>So, let’s see how mini-batch gradient descent works</strong>. To run mini-batch gradient descent on your training sets you run for T equals 1 to 5,000 because we had 5,000 mini batches as high as 1,000 each. What are you going to do inside the for loop is basically implement one step of gradient descent using XT comma YT. It is as if you had a training set of size 1,000 examples and it was as if you were to implement the overall you are already familiar with but just on this little training set size of M equals 1,000 rather than having an explicit for loop over all 1,000 examples, you would use vectorization to process all 1,000 examples sort of all at the same time. Let us write this out first, you implemented for a prop on the inputs. So just on XT and you do that by implementing Z1 equals W1.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/2.png" alt=""><br>Previously, we would just have X there, right? But now you are processing the entire training set, you are just processing the first mini-batch so that it becomes XT when you’re processing mini-batch T. Then you will have A1 equals G1 of Z1, a capital Z since this is actually a vectorizing connotation and so on until you end up with AL, answer is GL of ZL and then this is your prediction. And you notice that here you should use a vectorized implementation. It’s just that this vectorized implementation processes 1,000 examples at a time rather than 5 million examples. Next you compute the cost function J which I’m going to write as one over 1,000 since here 1,000 is the size of your little training set. Sum from I equals one through L of really the loss of YI and this notation for clarity, refers to examples from the mini batch XT YT. And if you’re using regularization, you can also have this regularization term. Move it to the denominator times sum of L, Frobenius on the way makes it a square. Because this is really the cost on just one mini-batch, I’m going to index as cost J with a superscript T in curly braces. You notice that everything we are doing is exactly the same as when we were previously implementing gradient descent except that instead of doing it on XY, you’re not doing it on XT YT. Next, you implement that prop to compute gradients with respect to JT, you are still using only XT YT and then you update the weights W, read WL gets updated as WL minus alpha D WL and similarly for B. This is one pass through your training set using mini-batch gradient descent. The code I have written down here is also called doing <strong>one epoch of training</strong> and <strong>epoch is a word that means a single pass through the training set</strong>. Whereas with batch gradient descent, a single pass through the training allows you to take only one gradient descent step. With mini-batch gradient descent, a single pass through the training set, that is one epoch, allows you to take 5,000 gradient descent steps. </p>
<p>Now of course you want to take multiple passes through the training set which you usually want to, you might want another for loop for another while loop out there. So you keep taking passes through the training set until hopefully you converge with approximately converge. </p>
<p>When you have a lost training set, mini-batch gradient descent runs much faster than batch gradient descent and that’s pretty much what everyone in Deep Learning will use when you’re training on a large data set. In the next video, let’s delve deeper into mini-batch gradient descent so you can get a better understanding of what it is doing and why it works so.</p>
<h2 id="02-understanding-mini-batch-gradient-descent"><a href="#02-understanding-mini-batch-gradient-descent" class="headerlink" title="02_understanding-mini-batch-gradient-descent"></a>02_understanding-mini-batch-gradient-descent</h2><p>In the previous video, you saw how you can use mini-batch gradient descent to start making progress and start taking gradient descent steps, even when you’re just partway through processing your training set even for the first time. <strong>In this video, you learn more details of how to implement gradient descent and gain a better understanding of what it’s doing and why it works</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/3.png" alt=""><br>With batch gradient descent on every iteration you go through the entire training set and you’d expect the cost to go down on every single iteration. So if we’ve had the cost function j as a function of different iterations it should decrease on every single iteration. And if it ever goes up even on iteration then something is wrong. Maybe you’re running ways to big. On mini batch gradient descent though, if you plot progress on your cost function, then it may not decrease on every iteration. In particular, on every iteration you’re processing some X{t}, Y{t} and so if you plot the cost function J{t}, which is computer using just X{t}, Y{t}. Then it’s as if on every iteration you’re training on a different training set or really training on a different mini batch. So you plot the cross function J, you’re more likely to see something that looks like this. It should trend downwards, but it’s also going to be <strong>a little bit noisier</strong>. So if you plot J{t}, as you’re training mini batch in descent it may be over multiple epochs, you might expect to see a curve like this. So it’s okay if it doesn’t go down on every derivation. But it should trend downwards, and the reason it’ll be a little bit noisy is that, maybe X{1}, Y{1} is just the rows of easy mini batch so your cost might be a bit lower, but then maybe just by chance, X{2}, Y{2} is just a harder mini batch. <strong>Maybe you needed some mislabeled examples in it, in which case the cost will be a bit higher and so on</strong>. So that’s why you get these oscillations as you plot the cost when you’re running mini batch gradient descent. </p>
<p><strong>Now one of the parameters you need to choose is the size of your mini batch</strong>. So m was the training set size on one extreme, if the mini-batch size, = m, then you just end up with batch gradient descent. All right, so in this extreme you would just have one mini-batch X{1}, Y{1}, and this mini-batch is equal to your entire training set. So setting a mini-batch size m just gives you batch gradient descent. The other extreme would be if your mini-batch size, Were = 1. This gives you an algorithm called <strong>stochastic gradient descent</strong>. And here every example is its own mini-batch. So what you do in this case is you look at the first mini-batch, so X{1}, Y{1}, but when your mini-batch size is one, this just has your first training example, and you take gradient descent to sense that your first training example. And then you next take a look at your second mini-batch, which is just your second training example, and take your gradient descent step with that, and then you do it with the third training example and so on <strong>looking at just one single training sample at the time</strong>. </p>
<p>So let’s look at what these two extremes will do on optimizing this cost function. If these are the contours of the cost function you’re trying to minimize so your minimum is there. <strong>Then batch gradient descent might start somewhere and be able to take relatively low noise, relatively large steps</strong>. And you could just keep matching to the minimum.(Tip: The blue line shows this situation on the following slide)<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/4.png" alt=""><br><strong>In contrast with stochastic gradient descent</strong>, If you start somewhere let’s pick a different starting point. Then on every iteration you’re taking gradient descent with just a single strain example so most of the time you hit around at the global minimum. But sometimes you hit in the wrong direction if that one example happens to point you in a bad direction. So <strong>stochastic gradient descent can be extremely noisy. And on average, it’ll take you in a good direction, but sometimes it’ll head in the wrong direction as well. As stochastic gradient descent won’t ever converge, it’ll always just kind of oscillate and wander around the region of the minimum</strong>. But it won’t ever just head to the minimum and stay there.(Tip: The purple line shows this situation on the following slide)  </p>
<p>In practice, the mini-batch size you use will be somewhere in between. Somewhere between in 1 and m and 1 and m are respectively too small and too large. And here’s why. If you use batch grading descent, So this is your mini batch size equals m. Then you’re processing a huge training set on every iteration. So <strong>the main disadvantage of this is that it takes too much time too long per iteration assuming you have a very long training set. If you have a small training set then batch gradient descent is fine</strong>. If you go to the opposite, <strong>if you use stochastic gradient descent, Then it’s nice that you get to make progress after processing just tone example that’s actually not a problem. And the noisiness can be ameliorated or can be reduced by just using a smaller learning rate. But a huge disadvantage to stochastic gradient descent is that you lose almost all your speed up from vectorization. Because, here you’re processing a single training example at a time. The way you process each example is going to be very inefficient.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>So what works best in practice is something in between where you have some, Mini-batch size not to big or too small</strong>. And this gives you in practice the fastest learning. And you notice that <strong>this has two good things going for it. One is that you do get a lot of vectorization</strong>. So in the example we used on the previous video, if your mini batch size was 1000 examples then, you might be able to vectorize across 1000 examples which is going to be much faster than processing the examples one at a time. <strong>And second, you can also make progress, Without needing to wait til you process the entire training set</strong>. So again using the numbers we have from the previous video, each epoco each part your training set allows you to see 5,000 gradient descent steps. So in practice they’ll be some in-between mini-batch size that works best. And so with mini-batch gradient descent we’ll start here, maybe one iteration does this, two iterations, three, four. And It’s not guaranteed to always head toward the minimum but it tends to head more consistently in direction of the minimum than the consequent descent. And then it doesn’t always exactly convert or oscillate in a very small region. If that’s an issue you can always reduce the learning rate slowly. We’ll talk more about learning rate decay or how to reduce the learning rate in a later video. </p>
<p><strong>So if the mini-batch size should not be m and should not be 1 but should be something in between, how do you go about choosing it?</strong> Well, here are some guidelines. <strong>First</strong>, if you have a small training set, Just use batch gradient descent. If you have a small training set then no point using mini-batch gradient descent you can process a whole training set quite fast. So you might as well use batch gradient descent. What a small training set means, I would say if it’s less than maybe 2000 it’d be perfectly fine to just use batch gradient descent. <strong>Otherwise</strong>, if you have a bigger training set, typical mini batch sizes would be, Anything from 64 up to maybe 512 are quite typical. And <strong>because of the way computer memory is layed out and accessed, sometimes your code runs faster if your mini-batch size is a power of 2</strong>. All right, so 64 is 2 to the 6th, is 2 to the 7th, 2 to the 8, 2 to the 9, so often I’ll implement my mini-batch size to be a power of 2. I know that in a previous video I used a mini-batch size of 1000, if you really wanted to do that I would recommend you just use your 1024, which is 2 to the power of 10. And you do see mini batch sizes of size 1024, it is a bit more rare. This range of mini batch sizes(from 64 up to maybe 512), a little bit more common.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/5.png" alt=""><br><strong>One last tip is to make sure that your mini batch, All of your X{t}, Y{t} that that fits in CPU/GPU memory</strong>. And this really depends on your application and how large a single training sample is. But if you ever process a mini-batch that doesn’t actually fit in CPU, GPU memory, whether you’re using the process, the data. Then you find that the performance suddenly falls of a cliff and is suddenly much worse. So I hope this gives you a sense of the typical range of mini batch sizes that people use. <strong>In practice of course the mini batch size is another hyper parameter that you might do a quick search over to try to figure out which one is most sufficient of reducing the cost function j. So what i would do is just try several different values. Try a few different powers of two and then see if you can pick one that makes your gradient descent optimization algorithm as efficient as possible</strong>. But hopefully this gives you a set of guidelines for how to get started with that hyper parameter search. </p>
<p>You now know how to implement mini-batch gradient descent and make your algorithm run much faster, especially when you’re training on a large training set. But it turns out there’re even more efficient algorithms than gradient descent or mini-batch gradient descent. Let’s start talking about them in the next few videos. </p>
<h2 id="03-exponentially-weighted-averages"><a href="#03-exponentially-weighted-averages" class="headerlink" title="03_exponentially-weighted-averages"></a>03_exponentially-weighted-averages</h2><p>I want to show you a few optimization algorithms. They are faster than gradient descent. In order to understand those algorithms, you need to be able they use something called <strong>exponentially weighted averages</strong>. Also called <strong>exponentially weighted moving averages in statistics</strong>. Let’s first talk about that, and then we’ll use this to build up to more sophisticated optimization algorithms. </p>
<p>So, even though I now live in the United States, I was born in London. So, for this example I got the daily temperature from London from last year. So, on January 1, temperature was 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I know most of the world uses a Celsius system, but I guess I live in United States which uses Fahrenheit. So that’s four degrees Celsius. And on January 2, it was nine degrees Celsius and so on. And then about halfway through the year, a year has 365 days so, that would be, sometime day number 180 will be sometime in late May, I guess. It was 60 degrees Fahrenheit which is 15 degrees Celsius, and so on. So, it start to get warmer, towards summer and it was colder in January. So, you plot the data you end up with this.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/6.png" alt=""><br>Where day one being sometime in January, that you know, being the, beginning of summer, and that’s the end of the year, kind of late December. So, this would be January, January 1, is the middle of the year approaching summer, and this would be the data from the end of the year. </p>
<p>So, <strong>this data looks a little bit noisy and if you want to compute the trends</strong>, the local average or a moving average of the temperature, here’s what you can do. Let’s initialize $V_0$ equals zero. And then, on every day, we’re going to average it with a weight of 0.9 times whatever appears as value, plus 0.1 times that day temperature. So, theta one here would be the temperature from the first day. And on the second day, we’re again going to take a weighted average. 0.9 times the previous value plus 0.1 times today’s temperature and so on. Day two plus 0.1 times theta three and so on. <strong>And the more general formula is V on a given day is 0.9 times V from the previous day, plus 0.1 times the temperature of that day</strong>. So, if you compute this and plot it in red, this is what you get. You get a moving average of what’s called an <strong>exponentially weighted average of the daily temperature</strong>.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, let’s look at the equation we had from the previous slide, it was $V_t$ equals, previously we had 0.9. We’ll now turn that to prime to $\beta$,  $\beta \times V_{t-1} $ plus and it previously, was 0.1, I’m going to turn that into one minus beta times theta T, so, previously you had beta equals 0.9. <strong>It turns out that for reasons we are going to later, when you compute this you can think of $V_t$ as approximately averaging over, something like one over one minus beta, day’s temperature ($\frac{1}{1-\beta}\text{  days}$)</strong>. So, for example when beta goes 0.9 you could think of this as averaging over the last 10 days temperature. And that was the red line.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/8.png" alt=""><br>Now, let’s try something else. Let’s set beta to be very close to one, let’s say it’s 0.98. <strong>Then, if you look at ${1\over 1 - 0.98}$, this is equal to 50. So, this is, you know, think of this as averaging over roughly, the last 50 days temperature. And if you plot that you get this green line</strong>. So, notice a couple of things with this very high value of beta. <strong>The plot you get is much smoother because you’re now averaging over more days of temperature.</strong> So, the curve is just, you know, <strong>less wavy</strong> is now smoother, <strong>but on the flip side the curve has now shifted further to the right because you’re now averaging over a much larger window of temperatures</strong>. And by averaging over a larger window, this formula, this exponentially weighted average formula. <strong>It adapts more slowly, when the temperature changes. So, there’s just a bit more latency. And the reason for that is when Beta 0.98 then it’s giving a lot of weight to the previous value and a much smaller weight just 0.02, to whatever you’re seeing right now. So, when the temperature changes, when temperature goes up or down, there’s exponentially weighted average. Just adapts more slowly when beta is so large</strong>. </p>
<p>Now, let’s try another value. <strong>If you set beta to another extreme, let’s say it is 0.5, then this by the formula we have on the right. This is something like averaging over just two days temperature, and you plot that you get this yellow line</strong>. And by averaging only over two days temperature, you have a much, as if <strong>you’re averaging over much shorter window. So, you’re much more noisy, much more susceptible to outliers. But this adapts much more quickly to what the temperature changes</strong>. So, this formula is highly implemented, exponentially weighted average. Again, it’s called an exponentially weighted, moving average in the statistics literature. We’re going to call it exponentially weighted average for short and <strong>by varying this parameter or later we’ll see such a hyper parameter if you’re learning algorithm you can get slightly different effects</strong> and there will usually be some value in between that works best. That gives you the red curve which you know maybe looks like a beta average of the temperature than either the green or the yellow curve. </p>
<p>You now know the basics of how to compute exponentially weighted averages. In the next video, let’s get a bit more intuition about what it’s doing.</p>
<h2 id="04-understanding-exponentially-weighted-averages"><a href="#04-understanding-exponentially-weighted-averages" class="headerlink" title="04_understanding-exponentially-weighted-averages"></a>04_understanding-exponentially-weighted-averages</h2><p>In the last video, we talked about exponentially weighted averages. <strong>This will turn out to be a key component of several optimization algorithms that you used to train your neural networks. So, in this video, I want to delve a little bit deeper into intuitions for what this algorithm is really doing</strong>. </p>
<p>Recall that this is a key equation for implementing exponentially weighted averages. And so, if beta equals 0.9 you got the red line. If it was much closer to one, if it was 0.98, you get the green line. And it it’s much smaller, maybe 0.5, you get the yellow line.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/9.png" alt=""><br>Let’s look a bit more than that to understand how this is computing averages of the daily temperature. So here’s that equation again, and <strong>let’s set beta equals 0.9</strong> and write out a few equations that this corresponds to. So whereas, when you’re implementing it you have T going from zero to one, to two to three, increasing values of T. To analyze it, I’ve written it with decreasing values of T. And this goes on.</p>
$$v_{100} = 0.9v_{99}+0.1\theta_{100}\\v_{99} = 0.9v_{98}+0.1\theta_{99}\\v_{98} = 0.9v_{97}+0.1\theta_{98}\\ \ldots$$

<p>So let’s take this first equation here, and understand what V100 really is. So V100 is going to be, let me reverse these two terms, it’s going to be 0.1 times theta 100, plus 0.9 times whatever the value was on the previous day. Now, but what is V99? Well, we’ll just plug it in from this equation. So this is just going to be 0.1 times theta 99, and again I’ve reversed these two terms, plus 0.9 times V98. But then what is V98? Well, you just get that from here. So you can just plug in here, 0.1 times theta 98, plus 0.9 times V97, and so on. And if you multiply all of these terms out, you can show that V100 is 0.1 times theta 100 plus. Now, let’s look at coefficient on theta 99, it’s going to be 0.1 times 0.9, times theta 99. Now, let’s look at the coefficient on theta 98, there’s a 0.1 here times 0.9, times 0.9. So if we expand out the Algebra, this become 0.1 times 0.9 squared, times theta 98. And, if you keep expanding this out, you find that this becomes 0.1 times 0.9 cubed, theta 97 plus 0.1, times 0.9 to the fourth, times theta 96, plus dot dot dot. </p>
$$v_{100}=0.1\theta_{100}+0.9(0.1\theta_{99}+0.9(0.1\theta_{98}+0.9v_{97}))+\cdots\\=0.1\theta_{100}+0.1\times0.9\theta_{99}+0.1\times(0.9)^{2}\theta_{98}+0.1\times(0.9)^{3}\theta_{97}+\cdots$$

<p>So this is really a way to sum and that’s a weighted average of theta 100, which is the current days temperature and we’re looking for a perspective of V100 which you calculate on the 100th day of the year. But those are sum of your theta 100, theta 99, theta 98, theta 97, theta 96, and so on. So one way to draw this in pictures would be if, let’s say we have some number of days of temperature. So this is theta and this is T.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/10.png" alt=""><br>So theta 100 will be sum value, then theta 99 will be sum value, theta 98, so these are, so this is T equals 100, 99, 98, and so on, ratio of sum number of days of temperature. And what we have is then <strong>an exponentially decaying function</strong>. So starting from 0.1 to 0.9, times 0.1 to 0.9 squared, times 0.1, to and so on. So you have this exponentially decaying function. And the way you compute V100, is you take the element wise product between these two functions and sum it up. So you take this value, theta 100 times 0.1, times this value of theta 99 times 0.1 times 0.9, that’s the second term and so on. </p>
$$v_{100}=0.1\theta_{100}+0.9(0.1\theta_{99}+0.9(0.1\theta_{98}+0.9v_{97}))+\cdots\\=0.1\theta_{100}+0.1\times0.9\theta_{99}+0.1\times(0.9)^{2}\theta_{98}+0.1\times(0.9)^{3}\theta_{97}+\cdots$$

<p><strong>So it’s really taking the daily temperature, multiply with this exponentially decaying function, and then summing it up</strong>. And this becomes your V100. It turns out that, up to details that are for later. But all of these coefficients, add up to one or add up to very close to one, up to a detail called <strong>bias correction</strong> which we’ll talk about in the next video. But because of that, this really is an exponentially weighted average. </p>
<p><strong>And finally, you might wonder, how many days temperature is this averaging over</strong>. Well, it turns out that 0.9 to the power of 10, is about 0.35 and this turns out to be about one over E,$0.9^{10} \approx 0.35 \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon}$, one of the base of natural algorithms. And, more generally, if you have $1 - \epsilon$, so in this example, $\epsilon$ would be 0.1, so if this was 0.9, then one minus epsilon to the one over epsilon, $(1 - \epsilon)^\frac{1}{\epsilon} \approx {1\over e}\approx 0.34 \text{ or } 0.35$. And so, in other words, it takes about 10 days for the height of this to decay to around 1/3 already one over E of the peak. So it’s because of this, that when beta equals 0.9, we say that, this is as if you’re computing an exponentially weighted average that focuses on just the last 10 days temperature. <strong>Because it’s after 10 days that the weight decays to less than about a third of the weight of the current day</strong>. Whereas, in contrast, if beta was equal to 0.98, then, well, what do you need 0.98 to the power of in order for this to really small? Turns out that 0.98 to the power of 50 will be approximately equal to one over E, $0.98^{50} = \frac{1}{e}, \epsilon=0.02$. So the way to be pretty big will be bigger than one over E for the first 50 days, and then they’ll decay quite rapidly over that. So intuitively, this is the hard and fast thing, you can think of this as averaging over about 50 days temperature. Because, in this example, to use the notation here on the left, it’s as if epsilon is equal to 0.02, so one over epsilon is 50, $(1 - 0.02)^{\frac{1}{0.02}} = {1 \over e}$. And this, by the way, is how we got the formula, that we’re averaging over one minus beta or so days. Right here, epsilon replace a row of 1 minus beta. <strong>It tells you, up to some constant roughly how many days temperature you should think of this as averaging over. But this is just a rule of thumb for how to think about it, and it isn’t a formal mathematical statement</strong>. </p>
<p>Finally, let’s talk about how you actually implement this. Recall that we start over V0 initialized as zero, then compute V one on the first day, V2, and so on. Now, to explain the algorithm, it was useful to write down V0, V1, V2, and so on as distinct variables. But if you’re implementing this in practice, this is what you do: you initialize V to be called to zero, and then on day one, you would set V equals beta, times V, plus one minus beta, times theta one. And then on the next day, you add update V, to be called to beta V, plus 1 minus beta, theta 2, and so on. And some of it uses notation V subscript theta to denote that V is computing this exponentially weighted average of the parameter theta. So just to say this again but for a new format, you set V theta equals zero, and then, repeatedly, have one each day, you would get next theta T, and then set to V, theta gets updated as beta, times the old value of V theta, plus one minus beta, times the current value of V theta.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/12.png" alt=""><br><strong>So one of the advantages of this exponentially weighted average formula, is that it takes very little memory. You just need to keep just one row number in computer memory, and you keep on overwriting it with this formula based on the latest values that you got</strong>. And it’s really this reason, the efficiency, it just takes up one line of code basically and just storage and memory for a single row number to compute this exponentially weighted average. <strong>It’s really not the best way, not the most accurate way to compute an average. If you were to compute a moving window, where you explicitly sum over the last 10 days, the last 50 days temperature and just divide by 10 or divide by 50, that usually gives you a better estimate. But the disadvantage of that, of explicitly keeping all the temperatures around and sum of the last 10 days is it requires more memory, and it’s just more complicated to implement and is computationally more expensive</strong>. So for things, we’ll see some examples on the next few videos, where you need to compute averages of a lot of variables. This is a very efficient way to do so both from computation and memory efficiency point of view which is why it’s used in a lot of machine learning. Not to mention that there’s just one line of code which is, maybe, another advantage. </p>
<p>So, now, you know how to implement exponentially weighted averages. There’s one more technical detail that’s worth for you knowing about called bias correction. Let’s see that in the next video, and then after that, you will use this to build a better optimization algorithm than the straight forward create.</p>
<h2 id="05-bias-correction-in-exponentially-weighted-averages"><a href="#05-bias-correction-in-exponentially-weighted-averages" class="headerlink" title="05_bias-correction-in-exponentially-weighted-averages"></a>05_bias-correction-in-exponentially-weighted-averages</h2><p>You’ve learned how to implement exponentially weighted averages. <strong>There’s one technical detail called biased correction that can make you computation of these averages more accurately</strong>. Let’s see how that works. </p>
<p>In a previous video, you saw this figure for beta = 0.9. This figure for beta = 0.98. But it turns out that if you implement the formula as written here, you won’t actually get the green curve when, say, beta = 0.98. You actually get the purple curve here.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/14.png" alt=""><br>And <strong>you notice that the purple curve starts off really low</strong>. So let’s see how it affects that. When you’re implementing a moving average, you initialize it with v0 = 0, and then v1 = 0.98 V0 + 0.02 theta 1. But V0 is equal to 0 so that term just goes away. So V1 is just 0.02 times theta 1. So that’s why if the first day’s temperature is, say 40 degrees Fahrenheit, then v1 will be 0.02 times 40, which is 8. So you get a much lower value down here. <strong>So it’s not a very good estimate of the first day’s temperature</strong>. v2 will be 0.98 times v1 + 0.02 times theta 2. And if you plug in v1, which is this down here and multiply it out, then you find that v2 is actually equal to 0.98 times 0.02 times theta 1 + 0.02 times theta 2. And that 0.0 196 theta1 + 0.02 theta2. So again, assuming theta1 and theta2 are positive numbers, when you compute this v2 will be much less than theta1 or theta2. <strong>So v2 isn’t a very good estimate of the first two days’ temperature of the year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So it turns out that there is a way to modify this estimate that makes it much better, that makes it more accurate, especially during this initial phase of your estimate. Which is that, instead of taking $V_t$, take $V_t$ divided by 1- Beta to the power of t , ${V_t \over 1 - \beta^t}$, where t is the current data here on</strong>. So let’s take a concrete example. When t = 2, 1- beta to the power of t is 1- 0.98 squared and it urns out that this is 0.0396 $1-\beta^t=1-(0.98)^2 = 0.0396, \frac{V_2}{0.0396}=\frac{0.0196\theta_1+0.02\theta_2}{0.0396}$. And so your estimate of the tempature on day 2 becomes v2 divided by 0.0396 and this is going to be 0.0196 times theta 1 + 0.02 theta 2. You notice that these two things adds up to the denominator 0.03 and 6. And so this becomes a weighted average of theta 1 and theta 2 and this removes this bias.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/13.png" alt=""><br>So you notice that <strong>as t becomes large, beta to the t will approach 0 which is why when t is large enough, the bias correction makes almost no difference. This is why when t is large, the purple line and the green line pretty much overlap. But during this initial phase of learning when you’re still warming up your estimates when the bias correction can help you to obtain a better estimate of this temperature. And it is this bias correction that helps you go from the purple line to the green line.</strong></p>
<p>So in machine learning, for most implementations of the exponential weighted average, people don’t often bother to implement bias corrections. Because most people would rather just wait that initial period and have a slightly more biased estimate and go from there. But if you are concerned about the bias during this initial phase, while your exponentially weighted moving average is still warming up. Then bias correction can help you get a better estimate early on. So you now know how to implement exponentially weighted moving averages. Let’s go on and use this to build some better optimization algorithms. </p>
<h2 id="06-gradient-descent-with-momentum"><a href="#06-gradient-descent-with-momentum" class="headerlink" title="06_gradient-descent-with-momentum"></a>06_gradient-descent-with-momentum</h2><p>There’s an algorithm called momentum, or gradient descent with momentum that almost always works faster than the standard gradient descent algorithm. <strong>In one sentence, the basic idea is to compute an exponentially weighted average of your gradients, and then use that gradient to update your weights instead</strong>. In this video, let’s unpack that one sentence description and see how you can actually implement this. </p>
<p>As a example let’s say that you’re trying to optimize a cost function which has contours like this. So the red dot denotes the position of the minimum. Maybe you start gradient descent here<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/15.png" alt=""><br>and if you take one iteration of gradient descent either or descent maybe end up -heading there. But now you’re on the other side of this ellipse, and if you take another step of gradient descent maybe you end up doing that. And then another step, another step, and so on. And you see that gradient descents will sort of take a lot of steps, right? Just slowly oscillate toward the minimum. And this up and down oscillations slows down gradient descent and prevents you from using a much larger learning rate (just like the blue line above the slide). In particular, if you were to use a much larger learning rate you might end up over shooting and end up diverging like so. And so the need to prevent the oscillations from getting too big forces you to use a learning rate that’s not itself too large. <strong>Another way of viewing this problem is that on the vertical axis you want your learning to be a bit slower, because you don’t want those oscillations. But on the horizontal axis, you want faster learning. Right, because you want it to aggressively move from left to right, toward that minimum, toward that red dot</strong>. </p>
<p>So here’s what you can do if you implement gradient descent with momentum. On each iteration, or more specifically, during iteration t you would compute the usual derivatives dw, db. I’ll omit the superscript square bracket l’s but you compute dw, db on the current mini-batch. And if you’re using batch gradient descent, then the current mini-batch would be just your whole batch. And this works as well off a batch gradient descent. So if your current mini-batch is your entire training set, this works fine as well. And then what you do is you compute vdW to be Beta vdw plus 1 minus Beta dW. So this is similar to when we’re previously computing the theta equals beta v theta plus 1 minus beta theta t. Right, so <strong>it’s computing a moving average of the derivatives for w you’re getting</strong>. And then you similarly compute vdb equals that plus 1 minus Beta times db. And then you would update your weights using W gets updated as W minus the learning rate times, instead of updating it with dW, with the derivative, you update it with vdW. And similarly, b gets updated as b minus alpha times vdb. <strong>So what this does is smooth out the steps of gradient descent</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/16.png" alt=""><br>For example, let’s say that in the last few derivatives you computed were this, this, this, this, this. <strong>If you average out these gradients, you find that the oscillations in the vertical direction will tend to average out to something closer to zero. So, in the vertical direction, where you want to slow things down, this will average out positive and negative numbers, so the average will be close to zero. Whereas, on the horizontal direction, all the derivatives are pointing to the right of the horizontal direction, so the average in the horizontal direction will still be pretty big</strong>. So that’s why with this algorithm, with a few iterations you find that the gradient descent with momentum ends up eventually just taking steps that are much smaller oscillations in the vertical direction, but are more directed to just moving quickly in the horizontal direction. And <strong>so this allows your algorithm to take a more straightforward path, or to damp out the oscillations in this path to the minimum (jsut like the red line on the above slide)</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>One intuition for this momentum which works for some people</strong>, but not everyone is that if you’re trying to minimize your bowl shape function, right? This is really the contours of a bowl. I guess I’m not very good at drawing.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/17.png" alt=""><br>They kind of minimize this type of bowl shaped function then these derivative terms you can think of as providing <strong>acceleration</strong> to a ball that you’re rolling down hill. And these momentum terms you can think of as representing the <strong>velocity</strong>. And so imagine that you have a bowl, and you take a ball and the derivative imparts acceleration to this little ball as the little ball is rolling down this hill, right? And so it rolls faster and faster, because of acceleration. And Beta, because this number a little bit less than one, displays a row of <strong>friction</strong> and it prevents your ball from speeding up without limit. <strong>But so rather than gradient descent, just taking every single step independently of all previous steps. Now, your little ball can roll downhill and gain momentum, but it can accelerate down this bowl and therefore gain momentum</strong>. I find that this ball rolling down a bowl analogy, it seems to work for some people who enjoy physics intuitions. But it doesn’t work for everyone, so if this analogy of a ball rolling down the bowl doesn’t work for you, don’t worry about it. </p>
<p>Finally, let’s look at some details on how you implement this. Here’s the algorithm and <strong>so you now have two hyperparameters of the learning rate alpha, as well as this parameter Beta, which controls your exponentially weighted average</strong>. The most common value for Beta is 0.9. We’re averaging over the last ten days temperature. So it is averaging of the last ten iteration’s gradients. And in practice, Beta equals 0.9 works very well. <strong>Feel free to try different values and do some hyperparameter search, but 0.9 appears to be a pretty robust value</strong>. Well, and <strong>how about bias correction</strong>, right? So do you want to take vdW and vdb and divide it by 1 minus beta to the t. <strong>In practice, people don’t usually do this because after just ten iterations, your moving average will have warmed up and is no longer a bias estimate. So in practice, I don’t really see people bothering with bias correction when implementing gradient descent or momentum.</strong><br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/18.png" alt=""><br>And of course this process initialize the $v_{dW}$ equals 0. Note that this is a matrix of zeroes with the same dimension as dW, which has the same dimension as $W$. And $Vdb$ is also initialized to a vector of zeroes. So, the same dimension as db, which in turn has same dimension as b. Finally, I just want to mention that if you read the literature on gradient descent with momentum often you see it with this term, $(1- \beta)$, omitted, with this 1 minus Beta term omitted. So you end up with $v_{dW} = \beta v_{dW}+ dW$. <strong>And the net effect of using this version in purple is that $vdW$ ends up being scaled by a factor of $1-\beta$, or really ${1 \over 1-\beta}$. And so when you’re performing these gradient descent updates, $\alpha$ just needs to change by a corresponding value of ${1 \over 1-\beta}$. In practice, both of these will work just fine, it just affects what’s the best value of the learning rate $\alpha$. But I find that this particular formulation is a little less intuitive. Because one impact of this is that if you end up tuning the hyperparameter Beta, then this affects the scaling of $vdW$ and $vdb$ as well. And so you end up needing to retune the learning rate, $alpha$, as well, maybe. So I personally prefer the formulation that I have written here on the left, rather than leaving out the $1-\beta$ term. But, so I tend to use the formula on the left, the printed formula with the $1-\beta$ term. But both versions having Beta equal 0.9 is a common choice of hyper parameter.</strong> It’s just at alpha the learning rate would need to be tuned differently for these two different versions. </p>
<p>So that’s it for gradient descent with momentum. This will <strong>almost always</strong> work better than the straightforward gradient descent algorithm without momentum. But there’s still other things we could do to speed up your learning algorithm. Let’s continue talking about these in the next couple videos. </p>
<h2 id="07-rmsprop"><a href="#07-rmsprop" class="headerlink" title="07_rmsprop"></a>07_rmsprop</h2><p>You’ve seen how using momentum can speed up gradient descent. There’s another algorithm called <strong>RMSprop</strong>, which stands for <strong>root mean square prop</strong>, that can also speed up gradient descent. Let’s see how it works. </p>
<p>Recall our example from before, that if you implement gradient descent, you can end up with huge oscillations in the vertical direction, even while it’s trying to make progress in the horizontal direction.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/15.png" alt=""><br><strong>In order to provide intuition for this example, let’s say that the vertical axis is the parameter b and horizontal axis is the parameter w</strong>. It could be w1 and w2 where some of the center parameters was named as b and w for the sake of intuition. <strong>And so, you want to slow down the learning in the b direction, or in the vertical direction. And speed up learning, or at least not slow it down in the horizontal direction. So this is what the RMSprop algorithm does to accomplish this</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/19.png" alt=""></p>

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Compute dW, db on current mini-batch : }\\
SdW &= \beta SdW + (1 - \beta)(dW)^2 \\
Sdb &= \beta Sdb + (1 - \beta)(db)^2 \\
W &:= W - \alpha \frac{dW}{\sqrt{SdW + \epsilon}} \\
b &:= b - \alpha \frac{db}{\sqrt{Sdb + \epsilon}}
\end{align*}
$$


<p>On iteration t, it will compute as usual the derivative dW, db on the current mini-batch. So I was going to keep this exponentially weighted average. Instead of $VdW$, I’m going to use the new notation $SdW$. So $SdW$ is equal to beta times their previous value + 1- beta times dW squared , $SdW = \beta SdW + (1-\beta) (dW)^2$. Sometimes write this $dW ^ 2$ to explain exponenation. So for clarity, this squaring operation is an element-wise squaring operation. <strong>So what this is doing is really keeping an exponentially weighted average of the squares of the derivatives</strong>. And similarly, we also have $Sdb = \beta Sdb + 1 - \beta (db)^2$. And again, <strong>the squaring is an element-wise operation</strong>. <strong>Next, RMSprop then updates the parameters as follows</strong>. W gets updated as W minus the learning rate, and whereas previously we had alpha times dW, now it’s dW divided by square root of SdW. And b gets updated as b minus the learning rate times, instead of just the gradient, this is also divided by, now divided by Sdb.</p>
<p>So let’s <strong>gain some intuition</strong> about how this works. Recall that <strong>in the horizontal direction or in this example, in the W direction we want learning to go pretty fast. Whereas in the vertical direction or in this example in the b direction, we want to slow down all the oscillations into the vertical direction. So with this terms SdW an Sdb, what we’re hoping is that SdW will be relatively small, so that here we’re dividing by relatively small number. Whereas Sdb will be relatively large, so that here we’re dividing yt relatively large number in order to slow down the updates on a vertical dimension</strong>. And indeed if you look at the derivatives, <strong>these derivatives are much larger in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction</strong>. So the slope is very large in the b direction, right? So with derivatives like this, this is a very large db and a relatively small dw. <strong>Because the function is sloped much more steeply in the vertical direction than as in the horizontal direction</strong>, than in the w direction, than in b direction. </p>
<p><strong>And so, db squared will be relatively large. So Sdb will relatively large, whereas compared to that dW will be smaller, or dW squared will be smaller, and so SdW will be smaller</strong>. So the net effect of this is that your updates in the vertical direction are divided by a much larger number, and so that helps damp out the oscillations. Whereas the updates in the horizontal direction are divided by a smaller number. <strong>So the net impact of using RMSprop is that your updates will end up looking more like this. That your updates in the, Vertical direction and then horizontal direction you can keep going. And one effect of this is also that you can therefore use a larger learning rate alpha, and get faster learning without diverging in the vertical direction</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Now just for the sake of clarity, I’ve been calling the vertical and horizontal directions b and w, just to illustrate this</strong>. In practice, you’re in a very high dimensional space of parameters, so maybe the vertical dimensions where you’re trying to damp the oscillation is a sum set of parameters, w1, w2, w17. And the horizontal dimensions might be w3, w4 and so on, right?. And so, the separation there’s a W and b is just an illustration. <strong>In practice, dW is a very high-dimensional parameter vector. db is also very high-dimensional parameter vector, but your intuition is that in dimensions where you’re getting these oscillations, you end up computing a larger sum. A weighted average for these squares and derivatives, and so you end up dumping out the directions in which there are these oscillations.</strong> </p>
<p>So that’s RMSprop, and it stands for root mean squared prop, because here you’re squaring the derivatives, and then you take the square root here at the end. </p>
<p>So finally, just a couple last details on this algorithm before we move on. <strong>In the next video, we’re actually going to combine RMSprop together with momentum. So rather than using the hyperparameter beta, which we had used for momentum, I’m going to call this hyperparameter beta 2 just to not clash the same hyperparameter for both momentum and for RMSprop</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>And also to make sure that your algorithm doesn’t divide by 0. What if square root of SdW, right, is very close to 0. Then things could blow up. Just to ensure numerical stability, when you implement this in practice you add a very, very small epsilon to the denominator. It doesn’t really matter what epsilon is used. 10 to the -8 would be a reasonable default, but this just ensures slightly greater numerical stability that for numerical round off or whatever reason, that you don’t end up dividing by a very, very small number</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>So that’s RMSprop, and similar to momentum, has the effects of damping out the oscillations in gradient descent, in mini-batch gradient descent. And allowing you to maybe use a larger learning rate alpha. And certainly speeding up the learning speed of your algorithm</strong>. </p>
<p>So now you know to implement RMSprop, and this will be another way for you to speed up your learning algorithm. One fun fact about RMSprop, it was actually first proposed not in an academic research paper, but in a Coursera course that Jeff Hinton had taught on Coursera many years ago. I guess Coursera wasn’t intended to be a platform for dissemination of novel academic research, but it worked out pretty well in that case. And was really from the Coursera course that RMSprop started to become widely known and it really took off. We talked about momentum. We talked about RMSprop. It turns out that if you put them together you can get an even better optimization algorithm. Let’s talk about that in the next video. </p>
<h2 id="08-adam-optimization-algorithm"><a href="#08-adam-optimization-algorithm" class="headerlink" title="08_adam-optimization-algorithm"></a>08_adam-optimization-algorithm</h2><p><strong>During the history of deep learning, many researchers including some very well-known researchers, sometimes proposed optimization algorithms and showed that they worked well in a few problems. But those optimization algorithms subsequently were shown not to really generalize that well to the wide range of neural networks you might want to train</strong>. So over time, I think the deep learning community actually developed some amount of skepticism about new optimization algorithms. <strong>And a lot of people felt that gradient descent with momentum really works well, was difficult to propose things that work much better. So, rms prop and the Adam optimization algorithm, which we’ll talk about in this video, is one of those rare algorithms that has really stood up, and has been shown to work well across a wide range of deep learning architectures So, this is one of the algorithms that I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend you try because many people have tried it and seen it work well on many problems. And the Adam optimization algorithm is basically taking momentum and rms prop and putting them together</strong>. So, let’s see how that works. </p>
<ol>
<li>initialization: $V_{dw} = 0, S_{dw}=0, V_{db}=0, S_{db} = 0$</li>
<li>on the t iteration:<br> Compute dw，db on the current mini-batch:<ul>
<li>Momentum: $V_{dw}=\beta_{1}V_{dw}+(1-\beta_{1})dw, V_{db}=\beta_{1}V_{db}+(1-\beta_{1})db$</li>
<li>RMSprop: $S_{dw}=\beta_{2}S_{dw}+(1-\beta_{2})(dw)^{2},S_{db}=\beta_{2}S_{db}+(1-\beta_{2})(db)^{2}$</li>
<li>bias correction: $V_{dw}^{corrected} = V_{dw}/(1-\beta_{1}^{t}),V_{db}^{corrected} = V_{db}/(1-\beta_{1}^{t})$ </li>
<li>bias correction: $S_{dw}^{corrected} = S_{dw}/(1-\beta_{2}^{t}),S_{db}^{corrected} = S_{db}/(1-\beta_{2}^{t})$</li>
<li>update parameters: $w:=w-\alpha\dfrac{V_{dw}^{corrected}}{\sqrt{S_{dw}^{corrected}}+\varepsilon},b:=b-\alpha\dfrac{V_{db}^{corrected}}{\sqrt{S_{db}^{corrected}}+\varepsilon}$ </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To implement Adam you would initialize: Vdw=0, Sdw=0, and similarly Vdb, Sdb=0. And then on iteration T, you would compute the derivatives: compute dw, db using current mini-batch. So usually, you do this with mini-batch gradient descent. And then you do the momentum exponentially weighted average. So Vdw = ß. But now I’m going to this ß1 to distinguish it from the hyper parameter ß2 we’ll use for the rms prop proportion of this. So, this is exactly what we had when we’re implementing momentum except it now called hyper parameter ß1 instead of ß. And similarly, you have VDB as follows: 1 - ß1 x db. And then you do the rms prop update as well. So now, you have a different hyperparemeter ß2 plus one minus ß2 dw². And again, the squaring there is element y squaring of your derivatives dw. And then sdb is equal to this plus one minus ß2 times db. So this is the momentum like update with hyper parameter ß1 and this is the rms prop like update with hyper parameter ß2. In the typical implementation of Adam, you do implement bias correction. So you’re going to have v corrected. Corrected means after bias correction. Dw = vdw divided by 1 minus ß1 to the power of T if you’ve done T iterations. And similarly, vdb corrected equals vdb divided by 1 minus ß1 to the power of T. And then similarly, you implement this bias correction on S as well. So, that’s sdw divided by one minus ß2 to the T and sdb corrected equals sdb divided by 1 minus ß2 to the T. Finally, you perform the update. So W gets updated as W minus alpha times. So if you’re just implementing momentum you’d use vdw, vw or maybe vdw corrected. But now, we add in the rms prop portion of this. So we’re also going to divide by square roots of sdw corrected plus epsilon. And similarly, B gets updated as a similar formula, vdb corrected, divided by square root S, corrected, db, plus epsilon. <strong>And so, this algorithm combines the effect of gradient descent with momentum together with gradient descent with rms prop. And this is a commonly used learning algorithm that is proven to be very effective for many different neural networks of a very wide variety of architectures</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, this algorithm has a number of hyper parameters. The learning with hyper parameter alpha is still important and usually needs to be tuned. So you just have to try a range of values and see what works. A common choice really the default choice for ß1 is 0.9. So this is a moving average, weighted average of dw right this is the momentum light term. The hyper parameter for ß2, the authors of the Adam paper, inventors of the Adam algorithm recommend 0.999. Again this is computing the moving weighted average of dw2 as well as db squares. And then Epsilon, the choice of epsilon doesn’t matter very much. But the authors of the Adam paper recommended it 10 to the minus 8. But this parameter you really don’t need to set it and it doesn’t affect performance much at all. But when implementing Adam, what people usually do is just use the default value. So, ß1 and ß2 as well as epsilon. <strong>I don’t think anyone ever really tunes $\epsilon$. And then, try a range of values of $\alpha$ to see what works best. You could also tune $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ but it’s not done that often among the practitioners I know.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/21.png" alt=""><br>So, where does the term ‘Adam’ come from? <strong>Adam stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation</strong>. So ß1 is computing the mean of the derivatives. This is called the first moment. And ß2 is used to compute exponentially weighted average of the ²s and that’s called the second moment. So that gives rise to the name adaptive moment estimation. But everyone just calls it the Adam authorization algorithm. And, by the way, one of my long term friends and collaborators is call Adam Coates. As far as I know, this algorithm doesn’t have anything to do with him, except for the fact that I think he uses it sometimes. But sometimes I get asked that question, so just in case you’re wondering. </p>
<p>So, that’s it for the Adam optimization algorithm. With it, I think you will be able to train your neural networks much more quickly. But before we wrap up for this week, let’s keep talking about hyper parameter tuning, as well as gain some more intuitions about what the optimization problem for neural networks looks like. In the next video, we’ll talk about learning rate decay.</p>
<h2 id="09-learning-rate-decay"><a href="#09-learning-rate-decay" class="headerlink" title="09_learning-rate-decay"></a>09_learning-rate-decay</h2><p>One of the things that might help speed up your learning algorithm, is to <strong>slowly reduce your learning rate over time</strong>. We call this learning rate decay. </p>
<p>Let’s see how you can implement this. Let’s start with an example of why you might want to implement learning rate decay. Suppose you’re implementing mini-batch gradient descent, with a reasonably small mini-batch. Maybe a mini-batch has just 64, 128 examples. Then as you iterate, your steps will be a little bit noisy. And it will tend towards this minimum over here, but it won’t exactly converge. But your algorithm might just end up wandering around, and never really converge, because you’re using some fixed value for alpha. And there’s just some noise in your different mini-batches.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/22.png" alt=""><br>But if you were to slowly reduce your learning rate alpha, then during the initial phases, while your learning rate alpha is still large, you can still have relatively fast learning. But then as alpha gets smaller, your steps you take will be slower and smaller. And so you end up oscillating in a tighter region around this minimum, rather than wandering far away, even as training goes on and on. So the intuition behind slowly reducing alpha, is that maybe during the initial steps of learning, you could afford to take much bigger steps. But then as learning approaches converges, then having a slower learning rate allows you to take smaller steps. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/23.png" alt=""><br>So here’s how you can implement learning rate decay. Recall that one epoch is one pass, Through the data, right? So if you have a training set as follows, maybe you break it up into different mini-batches. Then the first pass through the training set is called the first epoch, and then the second pass is the second epoch, and so on. So one thing you could do, is set your learning rate alpha = 1 / 1 + a parameter, which I’m going to call the decay rate, Times the epoch-num. And this is going to be times some initial learning rate alpha 0. Note that the decay rate here becomes another hyper-parameter, which you might need to tune. So here’s a concrete example. If you take several epochs, so several passes through your data. If alpha 0 = 0.2, and the decay-rate = 1, then during your first epoch, alpha will be 1 / 1 + 1 * alpha 0. So your learning rate will be 0.1. That’s just evaluating this formula, when the decay-rate is equal to 1, and the the epoch-num is 1. On the second epoch, your learning rate decays to 0.67. On the third, 0.5, on the fourth, 0.4, and so on. And feel free to evaluate more of these values yourself. And get a sense that, as a function of your epoch number, your learning rate gradually decreases, right, according to this formula up on top. So if you wish to use learning rate decay, what you can do, is try a variety of values of both hyper-parameter alpha 0. As well as this decay rate hyper-parameter, and then try to find the value that works well. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/24.png" alt=""><br>Other than this formula for learning rate decay, <strong>there are a few other ways</strong> that people use. For example, this is called <strong>exponential decay</strong>. Where alpha is equal to some number less than 1, such as 0.95 times epoch-num, times alpha 0. So this will exponentially quickly decay your learning rate. Other formulas that people use are things like alpha = some constant / epoch-num square root times alpha 0. Or some constant k, another hyper-parameter, over the mini-batch number t, square rooted, times alpha 0. And sometimes you also see people use a learning rate that decreases in discrete steps. Wherefore some number of steps, you have some learning rate, and then after a while you decrease it by one half. After a while by one half. After a while by one half. And so this is a discrete staircase. So so far, we’ve talked about using some formula to govern how alpha, the learning rate, changes over time. One other thing that people sometimes do, is manual decay. And so if you’re training just one model at a time, and if your model takes many hours, or even many days to train. What some people will do, is just watch your model as it’s training over a large number of days. And then manually say, it looks like the learning rate slowed down, I’m going to decrease alpha a little bit. Of course this works, this manually controlling alpha, really tuning alpha by hand, hour by hour, or day by day. This works only if you’re training only a small number of models, but sometimes people do that as well. </p>
<p>So now you have a few more options for how to control the learning rate alpha. Now, in case you’re thinking, wow, this is a lot of hyper-parameters. How do I select amongst all these different options? I would say, don’t worry about it for now. <strong>In next week, we’ll talk more about how to systematically choose hyper-parameters</strong>. <strong>For me, I would say that learning rate decay is usually lower down on the list of things I try. Setting alpha, just a fixed value of alpha, and getting that to be well tuned, has a huge impact</strong>. Learning rate decay does help. Sometimes it can really help speed up training, but it is a little bit lower down my list in terms of the things I would try. <strong>But next week, when we talk about hyper-parameter tuning, you see more systematic ways to organize all of these hyper-parameters. And how to efficiently search amongst them</strong>. So that’s it for learning rate decay. </p>
<p>Finally, I was also going to talk a little bit about local optima, and saddle points, in neural networks. So you can have a little bit better intuition about the types of optimization problems your optimization algorithm is trying to solve, when you’re trying to train these neural networks. Let’s go on to the next video to see that. </p>
<h2 id="10-the-problem-of-local-optima"><a href="#10-the-problem-of-local-optima" class="headerlink" title="10_the-problem-of-local-optima"></a>10_the-problem-of-local-optima</h2><p>In the early days of deep learning, people used to worry a lot about the optimization algorithm getting stuck in bad local optima. But as this theory of deep learning has advanced, our understanding of local optima is also changing. Let me show you how we now think about local optima and problems in the optimization problem in deep learning. </p>
<p>This was a picture people used to have in mind when they worried about local optima. Maybe you are trying to optimize some set of parameters, we call them W1 and W2, and the height in the surface is the cost function.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/26.png" alt=""><br>In this picture, it looks like there are a lot of local optima in all those places. And it’d be easy for grading the sense, or one of the other algorithms to get stuck in a local optimum rather than find its way to a global optimum. It turns out that if you are plotting a figure like this in two dimensions, then it’s easy to create plots like this with a lot of different local optima. And these very low dimensional plots used to guide their intuition. But this intuition isn’t actually correct. <strong>It turns out if you create a neural network, most points of zero gradients are not local optima like points like this. Instead most points of zero gradient in a cost function are saddle points</strong>. So, that’s a point where the zero gradient, again, just is maybe W1, W2, and the height is the value of the cost function J. </p>
<p><strong>But informally, a function of very high dimensional space, if the gradient is zero, then in each direction it can either be a convex light function or a concave light function</strong>. And if you are in, say, a 20,000 dimensional space, then for it to be a local optima, all 20,000 directions need to look like this. <strong>And so the chance of that happening is maybe very small, maybe two to the minus 20,000. Instead you’re much more likely to get some directions where the curve bends up like so, as well as some directions where the curve function is bending down rather than have them all bend upwards. So that’s why in very high-dimensional spaces you’re actually much more likely to run into a saddle point like that shown on the right, than the local optimum.</strong> </p>
<p>As for why the surface is called a saddle point, if you can picture, maybe this is a sort of saddle you put on a horse, right? Maybe this is a horse. This is a head of a horse, this is the eye of a horse. Well, not a good drawing of a horse but you get the idea. Then you, the rider, will sit here in the saddle.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/02_optimization-algorithms/25.png" alt=""><br>That’s why this point here, where the derivative is zero, that point is called a saddle point. There’s really the point on this saddle where you would sit, I guess, and that happens to have derivative zero. And so, <strong>one of the lessons we learned in history of deep learning is that a lot of our intuitions about low-dimensional spaces, like what you can plot on the left, they really don’t transfer to the very high-dimensional spaces that any other algorithms are operating over. Because if you have 20,000 parameters, then J as your function over 20,000 dimensional vector, then you’re much more likely to see saddle points than local optimum</strong>. </p>
<p>If local optima aren’t a problem, then what is a problem? It turns out that plateaus can really slow down learning and a plateau is a region where the derivative is close to zero for a long time. So if you’re here, then gradient descents will move down the surface, and because the gradient is zero or near zero, the surface is quite flat. You can actually take a very long time, you know, to slowly find your way to maybe this point on the plateau. And then because of a random perturbation of left or right, maybe then finally I’m going to search pen colors for clarity. Your algorithm can then find its way off the plateau. Let it take this very long slope off before it’s found its way here and they could get off this plateau. So the takeaways from this video are, first, you’re actually pretty unlikely to get stuck in bad local optima so long as you’re training a reasonably large neural network, save a lot of parameters, and the cost function J is defined over a relatively high dimensional space. But second, that plateaus are a problem and you can actually make learning pretty slow. And this is where algorithms like momentum or RmsProp or Adam can really help your learning algorithm as well. And these are scenarios where more sophisticated observation algorithms, such as Adam, can actually speed up the rate at which you could move down the plateau and then get off the plateau. </p>
<p><strong>So because your network is solving optimizations problems over such high dimensional spaces, to be honest, I don’t think anyone has great intuitions about what these spaces really look like, and our understanding of them is still evolving. But I hope this gives you some better intuition about the challenges that the optimization algorithms may face</strong>. </p>
<p>So that’s congratulations on coming to the end of this week’s content. Please take a look at this week’s quiz as well as the [inaudible] exercise. I hope you enjoy practicing some of these ideas of this week [inaudible] exercise and I look forward to seeing you at the start of next week’s videos.</p>

          <h2 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h2><p>This is my personal note at the first week after studying the course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization</a> and the copyright belongs to <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeplearning.ai</a>.</p>
<h2 id="01-hyperparameter-tuning"><a href="#01-hyperparameter-tuning" class="headerlink" title="01_hyperparameter-tuning"></a>01_hyperparameter-tuning</h2><h3 id="01-tuning-process"><a href="#01-tuning-process" class="headerlink" title="01_tuning-process"></a>01_tuning-process</h3><p>Hi, and welcome back. You’ve seen by now that changing neural nets can involve setting a lot of different hyperparameters. Now, how do you go about finding a good setting for these hyperparameters? In this video, I want to share with you some guidelines, some tips for how to systematically organize your hyperparameter tuning process, which hopefully will make it more efficient for you to converge on a good setting of the hyperparameters. </p>
<p>One of the painful things about training deepness is the sheer number of hyperparameters you have to deal with, ranging from the learning rate alpha to the momentum term beta, if using momentum, or the hyperparameters for the Adam Optimization Algorithm which are beta one, beta two, and epsilon. Maybe you have to pick the number of layers, maybe you have to pick the number of hidden units for the different layers, and maybe you want to use learning rate decay, so you don’t just use a single learning rate alpha. And then of course, you might need to choose the mini-batch size. So it turns out, some of these hyperparameters are more important than others.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/1.png" alt=""><br>The most learning applications I would say, alpha, <strong>the learning rate is the most important hyperparameter to tune</strong>. Other than alpha, <strong>a few other hyperparameters I tend to would maybe tune next, would be maybe the momentum term, say, 0.9 is a good default. I’d also tune the mini-batch size to make sure that the optimization algorithm is running efficiently. Often I also fiddle around with the hidden units. Of the ones I’ve circled in orange, these are really the three that I would consider second in importance to the learning rate alpha and then third in importance after fiddling around with the others, the number of layers can sometimes make a huge difference, and so can learning rate decay. And then when using the Adam algorithm I actually pretty much never tuned beta one, beta two, and epsilon. Pretty much I always use 0.9, 0.999 and tenth minus eight although you can try tuning those as well if you wish. But hopefully it does give you some rough sense of what hyperparameters might be more important than others, alpha, most important, for sure, followed maybe by the ones I’ve circle in orange, followed maybe by the ones I circled in purple. But this isn’t a hard and fast rule and I think other deep learning practitioners may well disagree with me or have different intuitions on these.</strong> </p>
<p>Now, if you’re trying to tune some set of hyperparameters, how do you select a set of values to explore? In earlier generations of machine learning algorithms, if you had two hyperparameters, which I’m calling hyperparameter one and hyperparameter two here, it was common practice to <strong>sample the points in a grid</strong> like so and systematically explore these values. Here I am placing down a five by five grid (Tip: as the left image on the following slide). In practice, it could be more or less than the five by five grid but you try out in this example all 25 points and then pick whichever hyperparameter works best. <strong>And this practice works okay when the number of hyperparameters was relatively small</strong>.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/2.png" alt=""><br><strong>In deep learning, what we tend to do, and what I recommend you do instead, is choose the points at random</strong>. So go ahead and choose maybe of same number of points, right? 25 points and then try out the hyperparameters on this randomly chosen set of points. <strong>And the reason you do that is that it’s difficult to know in advance which hyperparameters are going to be the most important for your problem</strong>. And as you saw in the previous slide, some hyperparameters are actually much more important than others. <strong>So to take an example, let’s say hyperparameter one turns out to be alpha, the learning rate. And to take an extreme example, let’s say that hyperparameter two was that value epsilon that you have in the denominator of the Adam algorithm</strong>. So your choice of alpha matters a lot and your choice of epsilon hardly matters. <strong>So if you sample in the grid then you’ve really tried out five values of alpha and you might find that all of the different values of epsilon give you essentially the same answer. So you’ve now trained 25 models and only got into trial five values for the learning rate alpha, which I think is really important. Whereas in contrast, if you were to sample at random, then you will have tried out 25 distinct values of the learning rate alpha and therefore you be more likely to find a value that works really well</strong>. I’ve explained this example, using just two hyperparameters. In practice, you might be searching over many more hyperparameters than these, so if you have, say, three hyperparameters, I guess instead of searching over a square, you’re searching over a cube where this third dimension is hyperparameter three and then by sampling within this three-dimensional cube you get to try out a lot more values of each of your three hyperparameters.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/3.png" alt=""><br><strong>And in practice you might be searching over even more hyperparameters than three and sometimes it’s just hard to know in advance which ones turn out to be the really important hyperparameters for your application and sampling at random rather than in the grid shows that you are more richly exploring set of possible values for the most important hyperparameters, whatever they turn out to be</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/4.png" alt=""><br>When you sample hyperparameters, <strong>another common practice is to use a coarse to fine sampling scheme</strong>. So let’s say in this two-dimensional example that you sample these points, and maybe you found that this point work the best and maybe a few other points(circled in blue color on the right down the above slide) around it tended to work really well, then in the course of the final scheme what you might do is zoom in to a smaller region of the hyperparameters and then sample more density within this space. Or maybe again at random, but to then focus more resources on searching within this blue square if you’re suspecting that the best setting, the hyperparameters, may be in this region. So after doing a coarse sample of this entire square, that tells you to then focus on a smaller square. You can then sample more densely into smaller square. So this type of a coarse to fine search is also frequently used. And by trying out these different values of the hyperparameters you can then pick whatever value allows you to do best on your training set objective or does best on your development set or whatever you’re trying to optimize in your hyperparameter search process. </p>
<p>So I hope this gives you a way to more systematically organize your hyperparameter search process. <strong>The two key takeaways are, use random sampling and adequate search and optionally consider implementing a coarse to fine search process.</strong> But there’s even more to hyperparameter search than this. Let’s talk more in the next video about how to choose the right scale on which to sample your hyperparameters.</p>
<h3 id="02-using-an-appropriate-scale-to-pick-hyperparameters"><a href="#02-using-an-appropriate-scale-to-pick-hyperparameters" class="headerlink" title="02_using-an-appropriate-scale-to-pick-hyperparameters"></a>02_using-an-appropriate-scale-to-pick-hyperparameters</h3><p>In the last video, you saw how sampling at random, over the range of hyperparameters, can allow you to search over the space of hyperparameters more efficiently. But it turns out that sampling at random doesn’t mean sampling uniformly at random, over the range of valid values. Instead, it’s important to pick the appropriate scale on which to explore the hyperparamaters. In this video, I want to show you how to do that. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/5.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say that you’re trying to choose the number of hidden units, n[l], for a given layer l. And let’s say that you think a good range of values is somewhere from 50 to 100. In that case, if you look at the number line from 50 to 100, maybe picking some number values at random within this number line. There’s a pretty visible way to search for this particular hyperparameter. Or if you’re trying to decide on the number of layers in your neural network, we’re calling that capital L. Maybe you think the total number of layers should be somewhere between 2 to 4. Then sampling uniformly at random, along 2, 3 and 4, might be reasonable. Or even using a grid search, where you explicitly evaluate the values 2, 3 and 4 might be reasonable. <strong>So these were a couple examples where sampling uniformly at random over the range you’re contemplating, might be a reasonable thing to do. But this is not true for all hyperparameters</strong>. </p>
<p>Let’s look at another example. Say your searching for the hyperparameter alpha, the learning rate. And let’s say that you suspect 0.0001 might be on the low end, or maybe it could be as high as 1. Now if you draw the number line from 0.0001 to 1, and sample values uniformly at random over this number line. Well about 90% of the values you sample would be between 0.1 and 1. So you’re using 90% of the resources to search between 0.1 and 1, and only 10% of the resources to search between 0.0001 and 0.1. So that doesn’t seem right.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/6.png" alt=""><br>Instead, it seems more reasonable to search for hyperparameters on a log scale. Where instead of using a linear scale, you’d have 0.0001 here, and then 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and then 1. And you instead sample uniformly, at random, on this type of <strong>logarithmic</strong> scale. Now you have more resources dedicated to searching between 0.0001 and 0.001, and between 0.001 and 0.01, and so on. So in Python, the way you implement this, is let r = -4 * np.random.rand(). And then a randomly chosen value of alpha, would be alpha = 10 to the power of r. So after this first line, r will be a random number between -4 and 0. And so alpha here will be between 10 to the -4 and 10 to the 0. So 10 to the -4 is this left thing, this 10 to the -4. And 1 is 10 to the 0. In a more general case, if you’re trying to sample between 10 to the a, to 10 to the b, on the log scale. And in this example, this is 10 to the a. And you can figure out what a is by taking the log base 10 of 0.0001, which is going to tell you a is -4. And this value on the right, this is 10 to the b. And you can figure out what b is, by taking log base 10 of 1, which tells you b is equal to 0. So what you do, is then sample r uniformly, at random, between a and b. So in this case, r would be between -4 and 0. And you can set alpha, on your randomly sampled hyperparameter value, as 10 to the r, okay? So just to recap, to sample on the log scale, you take the low value, take logs to figure out what is a. Take the high value, take a log to figure out what is b. So now you’re trying to sample, from 10 to the a to the b, on a log scale. So you set r uniformly, at random, between a and b. And then you set the hyperparameter to be 10 to the r. So that’s how you implement sampling on this logarithmic scale. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/7.png" alt=""><br><strong>Finally, one other tricky case is sampling the hyperparameter beta, used for computing exponentially weighted averages</strong>. So let’s say you suspect that beta should be somewhere between 0.9 to 0.999. Maybe this is the range of values you want to search over. So remember, that when computing exponentially weighted averages, using 0.9 is like averaging over the last 10 values. kind of like taking the average of 10 days temperature, whereas using 0.999 is like averaging over the last 1,000 values. So similar to what we saw on the last slide, if you want to search between 0.9 and 0.999, it doesn’t make sense to sample on the linear scale, right? Uniformly, at random, between 0.9 and 0.999. So the best way to think about this, is that we want to explore the range of values for 1 minus beta, which is going to now range from 0.1 to 0.001. And so we’ll sample the between beta, taking values from 0.1, to maybe 0.1, to 0.001. So using the method we have figured out on the previous slide, this is 10 to the -1, this is 10 to the -3. Notice on the previous slide, we had the small value on the left, and the large value on the right, but here we have reversed. We have the large value on the left, and the small value on the right. So what you do, is you sample r uniformly, at random, from -3 to -1. And you set 1- beta = 10 to the r, and so beta = 1- 10 to the r. And this becomes your randomly sampled value of your hyperparameter, chosen on the appropriate scale. And hopefully this makes sense, in that this way, you spend as much resources exploring the range 0.9 to 0.99, as you would exploring 0.99 to 0.999. So if you want to study more formal mathematical justification for why we’re doing this, right, <strong>why is it such a bad idea to sample in a linear scale? It is that, when beta is close to 1, the sensitivity of the results you get changes, even with very small changes to beta</strong>. So if beta goes from 0.9 to 0.9005, it’s no big deal, this is <strong>hardly any change</strong> in your results. But if beta goes from 0.999 to 0.9995, this will have <strong>a huge impact</strong> on exactly what your algorithm is doing, right? <strong>In both of these cases, it’s averaging over roughly 10 values. But here it’s gone from an exponentially weighted average over about the last 1,000 examples, to now, the last 2,000 examples</strong>. And it’s because that formula we have, 1 / 1- beta, this is <strong>very sensitive</strong> to small changes in beta, when beta is close to 1. So what this whole sampling process does, is it causes you to sample more densely in the region of when beta is close to 1. Or, alternatively, when 1- beta is close to 0. So that you can be more efficient in terms of how you distribute the samples, to explore the space of possible outcomes more efficiently. </p>
<p>So I hope this helps you select the right scale on which to sample the hyperparameters. In case you don’t end up making the right scaling decision on some hyperparameter choice, don’t worry to much about it. Even if you sample on the uniform scale, where sum of the scale would have been superior, you might still get okay results. Especially if you use a coarse to fine search, so that in later iterations, you focus in more on the most useful range of hyperparameter values to sample. I hope this helps you in your hyperparameter search. In the next video, I also want to share with you some thoughts of how to organize your hyperparameter search process. That I hope will make your workflow a bit more efficient. </p>
<h3 id="03-hyperparameters-tuning-in-practice-pandas-vs-caviar"><a href="#03-hyperparameters-tuning-in-practice-pandas-vs-caviar" class="headerlink" title="03_hyperparameters-tuning-in-practice-pandas-vs-caviar"></a>03_hyperparameters-tuning-in-practice-pandas-vs-caviar</h3><p>You have now heard a lot about how to search for good hyperparameters. Before wrapping up our discussion on hyperparameter search, I want to share with you just a couple of final tips and tricks for how to organize your hyperparameter search process. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/8.png" alt=""><br>Deep learning today is applied to many different application areas and that <strong>intuitions about hyperparameter settings from one application area may or may not transfer to a different one. There is a lot of cross-fertilization among different applications’ domains</strong>, so for example, I’ve seen ideas developed in the <strong>computer vision community</strong>, such as <strong>Confonets</strong> or <strong>ResNets</strong>, which we’ll talk about in a later course, successfully applied to speech. I’ve seen ideas that were first developed in speech successfully applied in <strong>NLP</strong>, and so on. <strong>So one nice development in deep learning is that people from different application domains do read increasingly research papers from other application domains to look for inspiration for cross-fertilization</strong>. In terms of your settings for the hyperparameters, though, I’ve seen that intuitions do get stale. So even if you work on just one problem, say logistics, you might have found a good setting for the hyperparameters and kept on developing your algorithm, or maybe seen your data gradually change over the course of several months, or maybe just upgraded servers in your data center. And because of those changes, the best setting of your hyperparameters can get stale. So I recommend maybe just retesting or reevaluating your hyperparameters at least once every several months to make sure that you’re still happy with the values you have. </p>
<p><strong>Finally, in terms of how people go about searching for hyperparameters, I see maybe two major schools of thought, or maybe two major different ways in which people go about it.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/9.png" alt=""><br>One way is if you <strong>babysit one model</strong>. And usually you do this <strong>if you have maybe a huge data set but not a lot of computational resources, not a lot of CPUs and GPUs, so you can basically afford to train only one model or a very small number of models at a time.</strong> In that case you might gradually babysit that model even as it’s training. So, for example, on Day 0 you might initialize your parameter as random and then start training. And you gradually watch your learning curve, maybe the cost function J or your dataset error or something else, gradually decrease over the first day. Then at the end of day one, you might say, gee, looks it’s learning quite well, I’m going to try increasing the learning rate a little bit and see how it does. And then maybe it does better. And then that’s your Day 2 performance. And after two days you say, okay, it’s still doing quite well. Maybe I’ll fill the momentum term a bit or decrease the learning variable a bit now, and then you’re now into Day 3. And every day you kind of look at it and try nudging up and down your parameters. And maybe on one day you found your learning rate was too big. So you might go back to the previous day’s model, and so on. But you’re kind of babysitting the model one day at a time even as it’s training over a course of many days or over the course of several different weeks. So that’s one approach, and people that babysit one model, that is watching performance and patiently nudging the learning rate up or down. But that’s usually what happens if you don’t have enough computational capacity to train a lot of models at the same time. </p>
<p><strong>The other approach would be if you train many models in parallel</strong>. So you might have some setting of the hyperparameters and just let it run by itself ,either for a day or even for multiple days, and then you get some learning curve like that; and this could be a plot of the cost function J or cost of your training error or cost of your dataset error, but some metric in your tracking. And then <strong>at the same time you might start up a different model with a different setting of the hyperparameters</strong>. And so, your second model might generate a different learning curve, maybe one that looks like that. I will say that one looks better. And at the same time, you might train a third model, which might generate a learning curve that looks like that, and another one that, maybe this one diverges so it looks like that, and so on. Or you might train many different models in parallel, where these orange lines are different models, right, and so this way you can try a lot of different hyperparameter settings and then just maybe quickly at the end pick the one that works best. Looks like in this example it was, maybe this curve that look best. </p>
<p>So to make an analogy, I’m going to call the approach on the left the panda approach. <strong>When pandas have children, they have very few children, usually one child at a time, and then they really put a lot of effort into making sure that the baby panda survives. So that’s really babysitting</strong>. One model or one baby panda. <strong>Whereas the approach on the right is more like what fish do. I’m going to call this the caviar strategy</strong>. There’s some fish that lay over 100 million eggs in one mating season. But the way fish reproduce is they lay a lot of eggs and don’t pay too much attention to any one of them but just see that hopefully one of them, or maybe a bunch of them, will do well. So I guess, this is really the difference between how mammals reproduce versus how fish and a lot of reptiles reproduce. But I’m going to call it the panda approach versus the caviar approach, since that’s more fun and memorable. So the way to choose between these two approaches is really a function of how much computational resources you have. If you have enough computers to train a lot of models in parallel, then by all means take the caviar approach and try a lot of different hyperparameters and see what works. </p>
<p>But in some application domains, I see this <strong>in some online advertising settings as well as in some computer vision applications, where there’s just so much data and the models you want to train are so big that it’s difficult to train a lot of models at the same time. It’s really application dependent of course, but I’ve seen those communities use the panda approach a little bit more, where you are kind of babying a single model along and nudging the parameters up and down and trying to make this one model work</strong>. Although, of course, even the panda approach, having trained one model and then seen it work or not work, maybe in the second week or the third week, maybe I should initialize a different model and then baby that one along just like even pandas, I guess, can have multiple children in their lifetime, even if they have only one, or a very small number of children, at any one time. </p>
<p>So hopefully this gives you a good sense of how to go about the hyperparameter search process. Now, it turns out that there’s one other technique that can make your neural network much more robust to the choice of hyperparameters. It doesn’t work for all neural networks, but when it does, it can make the hyperparameter search much easier and also make training go much faster. Let’s talk about this technique in the next video. </p>
<h2 id="02-batch-normalization"><a href="#02-batch-normalization" class="headerlink" title="02_batch-normalization"></a>02_batch-normalization</h2><h3 id="01-normalizing-activations-in-a-network"><a href="#01-normalizing-activations-in-a-network" class="headerlink" title="01_normalizing-activations-in-a-network"></a>01_normalizing-activations-in-a-network</h3><p>In the rise of deep learning, one of the most important ideas has been an algorithm called <strong>batch normalization</strong>, created by two researchers, Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy. Batch normalization makes your hyperparameter search problem much easier, makes your neural network much more robust. The choice of hyperparameters is a much bigger range of hyperparameters that work well, and will also enable you to much more easily train even very deep networks. Let’s see how batch normalization works. </p>
<p>When training a model, such as logistic regression, you might remember that normalizing the input features can speed up learnings in compute the means, subtract off the means from your training sets. Compute the variances. The sum of $x^{(i)}$ squared. This is an element-wise squaring. And then normalize your data set according to the variances. And we saw in an earlier video how this can turn the contours of your learning problem from something that might be very elongated to something that is more round, and easier for an algorithm like gradient descent to optimize. So this works, in terms of normalizing the input feature values to a neural network, alter the regression.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/10.png" alt=""><br>Now, how about a deeper model? You have not just input features x, but in this layer you have activations a1, in this layer, you have activations a2 and so on. So if you want to train the parameters, say w3, b3, then wouldn’t it be nice if you can normalize the mean and variance of a2 to make the training of w3, b3 more efficient? In the case of logistic regression, we saw how normalizing x1, x2, x3 maybe helps you train w and b more efficiently. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/12.png" alt=""><br><strong>So here, the question is, for any hidden layer, can we normalize</strong>, The values of a, let’s say a2, in this example but really any hidden layer, so as to train w3 b3 faster, right? Since a2 is the input to the next layer, that therefore affects your training of w3 and b3. So this is what batch norm does, batch normalization, or batch norm for short, does. Although technically, we’ll actually normalize the values of not a2 but z2. <strong>There are some debates in the deep learning literature about whether you should normalize the value before the activation function, so z2, or whether you should normalize the value after applying the activation function, a2. In practice, normalizing z2 is done much more often. So that’s the version I’ll present and what I would recommend you use as a default choice</strong>. </p>
<p>So here is how you will implement batch norm. Given some intermediate values, In your neural net, Let’s say that you have some hidden unit values $z^{[1]}$ up to $z^{[m]}$, and this is really from some hidden layer, so it’d be more accurate to write this as $z$ for some hidden layer i for i equals 1 through m. But to reduce writing, I’m going to omit this [l], just to simplify the notation on this line. So given these values, what you do is compute the mean as follows. Okay, and all this is specific to some layer l, but I’m omitting the [l].<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/11.png" alt=""><br>And then you compute the variance using pretty much the formula you would expect and then you would take each the zis and normalize it. So you get $z^{[i]}$ normalized by subtracting off the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. <strong>For numerical stability, we usually add epsilon to the denominator like that just in case sigma squared turns out to be zero in some estimate.</strong> And so now we’ve taken these values z and normalized them to have mean 0 and standard unit variance. So every component of z has mean 0 and variance 1. <strong>But we don’t want the hidden units to always have mean 0 and variance 1. Maybe it makes sense for hidden units to have a different distribution, so what we’ll do instead is compute, I’m going to call this z tilde = gamma zi norm + beta, $\tilde{z}=\gamma z^{[i]}_{norm}+\beta$. And here, $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are learnable parameters of your model.</strong> </p>
<p>So we’re using gradient descent, or some other algorithm, like the gradient descent of momentum, or RMSprop Adam, you would update the parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$, just as you would update the weights of your neural network. <strong>Now, notice that the effect of gamma and beta is that it allows you to set the mean of z tilde to be whatever you want it to be. In fact, if $\gamma$ equals square root $\sigma$ squared plus $\epsilon$, $\gamma = \sqrt{\sigma^2+\epsilon}$, so if $\gamma$ were equal to this denominator term. And if $\beta$ were equal to $\mu$, so this value up here, then the effect of $\gamma z_{norm} + \beta$ is that it would exactly invert this equation. So if this is true, then actually z tilde i is equal to zi. And so by an appropriate setting of the parameters gamma and beta, this normalization step, that is, these four equations is just computing essentially the identity function</strong>. But by choosing other values of $\gamma$ and $\beta$, this allows you to make the hidden unit values have other means and variances as well. And so the way you fit this into your neural network is, whereas previously you were using these values $z^{[1]}, z^{[2]}$, and so on, you would now use $\tilde{z}^{[i]}$, Instead of $z^{[i]}$ for the later computations in your neural network. And you want to put back in this [l] to explicitly denote which layer it is in, you can put it back there. So the intuition I hope you’ll take away from this is that we saw how normalizing the input features $x$ can help learning in a neural network. And what batch norm does is it applies that normalization process not just to the input layer, but to the values even deep in some hidden layer in the neural network. So it will apply this type of normalization to normalize the mean and variance of some of your hidden units’ values, $z$. <strong>But one difference between the training input and these hidden unit values is you might not want your hidden unit values be forced to have mean 0 and variance 1.</strong> For example, if you have a sigmoid activation function, you don’t want your values to always be clustered here.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/13.png" alt=""><br>You might want them to have a larger variance or have a mean that’s different than 0, in order to better take advantage of the nonlinearity of the sigmoid function rather than have all your values be in just this linear regime. <strong>So that’s why with the parameters gamma and beta, you can now make sure that your $z^{[i]}$ values have the range of values that you want. But what it does really is it then shows that your hidden units have standardized mean and variance, where the mean and variance are controlled by two explicit parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ which the learning algorithm can set to whatever it wants. So what it really does is it normalizes in mean and variance of these hidden unit values, really the $z^{[i]}$s, to have some fixed mean and variance. And that mean and variance could be 0 and 1, or it could be some other value, and it’s controlled by these parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$.</strong></p>
<p>So I hope that gives you a sense of the mechanics of how to implement batch norm, at least for a single layer in the neural network. In the next video, I’m going to show you how to fit batch norm into a neural network, even a deep neural network, and how to make it work for the many different layers of a neural network. And after that, we’ll get some more intuition about why batch norm could help you train your neural network. So in case why it works still seems a little bit mysterious, stay with me, and I think in two videos from now we’ll really make that clearer. </p>
<h3 id="02-fitting-batch-norm-into-a-neural-network"><a href="#02-fitting-batch-norm-into-a-neural-network" class="headerlink" title="02_fitting-batch-norm-into-a-neural-network"></a>02_fitting-batch-norm-into-a-neural-network</h3><p>So you have seen the equations for how to invent Batch Norm for maybe a single hidden layer. Let’s see how it fits into the training of a deep network. </p>
<p>So, let’s say you have a neural network like this, you’ve seen me say before that you can view each of the unit as computing two things.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>First, it computes Z and then it applies the activation function to compute A. And so we can think of each of these circles as representing a two step computation. And similarly for the next layer, that is Z2 1, and A2 1, and so on. So, if you were not applying Batch Norm, you would have an input X fit into the first hidden layer, and then first compute Z1, and this is governed by the parameters W1 and B1. And then ordinarily, you would fit Z1 into the activation function to compute A1. But what would do in Batch Norm is take this value Z1, and apply Batch Norm, sometimes abbreviated BN to it, and that’s going to be governed by parameters, Beta 1 and Gamma 1, and this will give you this new normalize value Z1. And then you fit that to the activation function to get A1, which is G1 applied to Z tilde 1. Now, you’ve done the computation for the first layer, where this Batch Norms that really occurs in between the computation from Z and A. Next, you take this value A1 and use it to compute Z2, and so this is now governed by W2, B2. And similar to what you did for the first layer, you would take Z2 and apply it through Batch Norm, and we abbreviate it to BN now. This is governed by Batch Norm parameters specific to the next layer. So Beta 2, Gamma 2, and now this gives you Z tilde 2, and you use that to compute A2 by applying the activation function, and so on. So once again, the Batch Norms that happens between computing Z and computing A. And the intuition is that, instead of using the un-normalized value Z, you can use the normalized value Z tilde, that’s the first layer. </p>
<p>The second layer as well, instead of using the un-normalized value Z2, you can use the mean and variance normalized values Z tilde 2. So the parameters of your network are going to be W1, B1. It turns out we’ll get rid of the parameters but we’ll see why in the next slide. But for now, imagine the parameters are the usual W1. B1, WL, BL, and we have added to this new network, additional parameters Beta 1, Gamma 1, Beta 2, Gamma 2, and so on, for each layer in which you are applying Batch Norm. <strong>For clarity, note that these Betas here, these have nothing to do with the hyperparameter beta that we had for momentum over the computing the various exponentially weighted averages</strong>. The authors of the Adam paper use Beta on their paper to denote that hyperparameter, the authors of the Batch Norm paper had used Beta to denote this parameter, <strong>but these are two completely different Betas. I decided to stick with Beta in both cases, in case you read the original papers. But the Beta 1, Beta 2, and so on, that Batch Norm tries to learn is a different Beta than the hyperparameter Beta used in momentum and the Adam and RMSprop algorithms.</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/15.png" alt=""><br>So now that these are the new parameters of your algorithm, you would then use whether optimization you want, such as creating descent in order to implement it. For example, you might compute $d\beta^{[L]}$ for a given layer, and then update the parameters $\beta$, gets updated as $\beta-\alpha d\beta^{[L]}$. And you can also use Adam or RMSprop or momentum in order to update the parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$, not just creating descent. And even though in the previous video, I had explained what the Batch Norm operation does, computes mean and variances and subtracts and divides by them. If they are using a Deep Learning Programming Framework, usually you won’t have to implement the Batch Norm step on Batch Norm layer yourself. So theprogramming  frameworks, that can be something like one line of code. So for example, in terms of flow framework, you can implement Batch Normalization with this function, <code>tf.nn.batch_normlization()</code>. We’ll talk more about programming frameworks later, but in practice you might not end up needing to implement all these details yourself, <strong>knowing how it works so that you can get a better understanding of what your code is doing. But implementing Batch Norm is often one line of code in the deep learning frameworks</strong>.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/16.png" alt=""><br>Now, so far, we’ve talked about Batch Norm as if you were training on your entire training set at the time as if you are using Batch gradient descent. <strong>In practice, Batch Norm is usually applied with mini-batches of your training set</strong>. So the way you actually apply Batch Norm is you take your first mini-batch and compute Z1. Same as we did on the previous slide using the parameters W1, B1 and then you take just this mini-batch and computer mean and variance of the Z1 on just this mini batch and then Batch Norm would subtract by the mean and divide by the standard deviation and then re-scale by Beta 1, Gamma 1, to give you Z1, and all this is on the first mini-batch, then you apply the activation function to get A1, and then you compute Z2 using W2, B2, and so on. So you do all this in order to perform one step of gradient descent on the first mini-batch and then goes to the second mini-batch X2, and you do something similar where you will now compute Z1 on the second mini-batch and then use Batch Norm to compute Z1 tilde. And so here in this Batch Norm step, You would be normalizing Z tilde using just the data in your second mini-batch, so does Batch Norm step here. Let’s look at the examples in your second mini-batch, computing the mean and variances of the Z1’s on just that mini-batch and re-scaling by Beta and Gamma to get Z tilde, and so on. And you do this with a third mini-batch, and keep training. </p>
<p>Now, there’s one detail to the parameterization that I want to clean up, which is previously, I said that the parameters was WL, BL, for each layer as well as $\beta^{[L]}$, and $\gamma^{[L]}$. Now notice that the way $Z$ was computed is as follows, $Z^{[L]} = W^{[L]} A^{[L-1]} + B^{[L]}$. But what Batch Norm does, is it is going to look at the mini-batch and normalize $Z^{[L]}$ to first of mean 0 and standard variance, and then a rescale by $\beta$ and $\gamma$. <strong>But what that means is that, whatever is the value of $B^{[L]}$ is actually going to just get subtracted out, because during that Batch Normalization step, you are going to compute the means of the $Z^{[L]}$’s and subtract the mean. And so adding any constant to all of the examples in the mini-batch, it doesn’t change anything. Because any constant you add will get cancelled out by the mean subtractions step. So, if you’re using Batch Norm, you can actually eliminate that parameter, or if you want, think of it as setting it permanently to 0</strong>. So then the parameterization becomes ZL is just WL x AL - 1, And then you compute ZL normalized, and we compute Z tilde = Gamma ZL + Beta, you end up using this parameter Beta L in order to decide whats that mean of Z tilde L. Which is why guess post in this layer. So just to recap, because Batch Norm zeroes out the mean of these ZL values in the layer, there’s no point having this parameter BL, and so you must get rid of it, and instead is sort of replaced by Beta L, which is a parameter that controls that ends up affecting the shift or the biased terms. </p>
<p>Finally, remember that the dimension of ZL, because if you’re doing this on one example, it’s going to be NL by 1, and so BL, a dimension, NL by one, if NL was the number of hidden units in layer L. And so the dimension of Beta L and Gamma L is also going to be NL by 1 because that’s the number of hidden units you have. You have NL hidden units, and so Beta L and Gamma L are used to scale the mean and variance of each of the hidden units to whatever the network wants to set them to. </p>
<p><strong>So, let’s pull all together and describe how you can implement gradient descent using Batch Norm</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for t = 1 to number of mini-batches</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Compute forward propagation on the min-batch $X^{[t]}$ </p>
<ul>
<li>In each hidden layer, use Batch Norm to replace $Z^{[l]}$ with $\tilde{Z}^{[l]}$</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Use back propagation to compute: $dw^{[l]}, dγ^{[l]}, dβ^{[l]}, dw^{[l]}, dγ^{[l]}, dβ^{[l]}$</p>
</li>
<li><p>Update: </p>
<ul>
<li>$W^{[l]}:=W^{[l]}−αdW^{[l]}$</li>
<li>$\Gamma^{[l]}:=\Gamma^{[l]}−αd\Gamma^{[l]}$</li>
<li>$\beta^{[l]}:=\beta^{[l]}−αd\beta^{[l]}$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>As well as mini-batch gradient descent, Batch Norm is used to momentum, RMSprop, Adam gradient descent to update the parameters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming you’re using mini-batch gradient descent, it rates for T = 1 to the number of many batches. You would implement forward prop on mini-batch XT and doing forward prop in each hidden layer, use Batch Norm to replace ZL with Z tilde L. And so then it shows that within that mini-batch, the value Z end up with some normalized mean and variance and the values and the version of the normalized mean that and variance is Z tilde L. And then, you use back prop to compute DW, DB, for all the values of L, D Beta, D Gamma. Although, technically, since you have got to get rid of B, this actually now goes away. And then finally, you update the parameters. So, W gets updated as W minus the learning rate times, as usual, Beta gets updated as Beta minus learning rate times DB, and similarly for Gamma. And if you have computed the gradient as follows, you could use gradient descent. That’s what I’ve written down here, but this also works with gradient descent with momentum, or RMSprop, or Adam. Where instead of taking this gradient descent update, mini-batch you could use the updates given by these other algorithms as we discussed in the previous week’s videos. Some of these other optimization algorithms as well can be used to update the parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ that Batch Norm added to algorithm. </p>
<p>So, I hope that gives you a sense of how you could implement Batch Norm from scratch if you wanted to. If you’re using one of the Deep Learning Programming frameworks which we will talk more about later, hopefully you can just call someone else’s implementation in the Programming framework which will make using Batch Norm much easier. Now, in case Batch Norm still seems a little bit mysterious if you’re still not quite sure why it speeds up training so dramatically, let’s go to the next video and talk more about why Batch Norm really works and what it is really doing.</p>
<h3 id="03-why-does-batch-norm-work"><a href="#03-why-does-batch-norm-work" class="headerlink" title="03_why-does-batch-norm-work"></a>03_why-does-batch-norm-work</h3><p>So, why does batch norm work? <strong>Here’s one reason, you’ve seen how normalizing the input features, the X’s, to mean zero and variance one, how that can speed up learning. So rather than having some features that range from zero to one, and some from one to a 1,000, by normalizing all the features, input features X, to take on a similar range of values that can speed up learning. So, one intuition behind why batch norm works is, this is doing a similar thing, but further values in your hidden units and not just for your input there</strong>. Now, this is just a partial picture for what batch norm is doing. There are a couple of further intuitions, that will help you gain a deeper understanding of what batch norm is doing. Let’s take a look at those in this video. </p>
<p><strong>A second reason why batch norm works, is it makes weights, later or deeper than your network, say the weight on layer 10, more robust to changes to weights in earlier layers of the neural network, say, in layer one.</strong> To explain what I mean, let’s look at this most vivid example. Let’s see a training on network, maybe a shallow network, like logistic regression or maybe a neural network, maybe a shallow network like this regression or maybe a deep network, on our famous cat detection toss.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/17.png" alt=""><br><strong>But let’s say that you’ve trained your data sets on all images of black cats. If you now try to apply this network to data with colored cats where the positive examples are not just black cats like on the left, but to color cats like on the right, then your cosfa might not do very well</strong>. So in pictures, if your training set looks like this (Tip: to see on the left of the following image), where you have positive examples here and negative examples here, but you were to try to generalize it, to a data set where maybe positive examples are here and the negative examples are here, then you might not expect a module trained on the data on the left to do very well on the data on the right. Even though there might be the same function that actually works well, but you wouldn’t expect your learning algorithm to discover that green decision boundary, just looking at the data on the left.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/18.png" alt=""><br>So, this idea of your data distribution changing goes by the somewhat fancy name, <strong>covariate shift</strong>. And the idea is that, if you’ve learned some X to Y mapping, if the distribution of X changes, then you might need to retrain your learning algorithm. And this is true even if the function, the ground true function, mapping from X to Y, remains unchanged, which it is in this example, because the ground true function is, is this picture a cat or not. And the need to retain your function becomes even more acute or it becomes even worse if the ground true function shifts as well.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/19.png" alt=""><br>So, how does this problem of covariate shift apply to a neural network? Consider a deep network like this, and let’s look at the learning process from the perspective of this certain layer, the third hidden layer. So this network has learned the parameters W3 and B3. And from the perspective of the third hidden layer, it gets some set of values from the earlier layers, and then it has to do some stuff to hopefully make the output Y-hat close to the ground true value Y.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/20.png" alt=""><br>So let me cover up the nose on the left for a second. So from the perspective of this third hidden layer, it gets some values, let’s call them A_2_1, A_2_2, A_2_3, and A_2_4. But these values might as well be features X1, X2, X3, X4, and the job of the third hidden layer is to take these values and find a way to map them to Y-hat. So you can imagine doing great intercepts, so that these parameters W_3_B_3 as well as maybe W_4_B_4, and even W_5_B_5, maybe try and learn those parameters, <strong>so the network does a good job, mapping from the values I drew in black on the left to the output values Y-hat</strong>.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/21.png" alt=""><br>But now let’s uncover the left of the network again. <strong>The network is also adapting parameters $W^{[2]}, B^{[2]}$ and $W^{[1]}, B^{[1]}$, and so as these parameters change, these values, $A^{[2]}$, will also change. So from the perspective of the third hidden layer, these hidden unit values are changing all the time, and so it’s suffering from the problem of covariate shift that we talked about on the previous slide. So what batch norm does, is it reduces the amount that the distribution of these hidden unit values shifts around.</strong><br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/22.png" alt=""><br>And if it were to plot the distribution of these hidden unit values, maybe this is technically renormalizer $Z$, so this is actually $Z^{[2]}_1$ and $Z^{[2]}_2$, and I also plot two values instead of four values, so we can visualize in 2D. What batch norm is saying is that, the values for $Z^{[2]}_1$ Z and $Z^{[2]}_2$  can change, and indeed they will change when the neural network updates the parameters in the earlier layers. But what batch norm ensures is that no matter how it changes, the mean and variance of $Z^{[2]}_1$ and $Z^{[2]}_2$ will remain the same. So even if the exact values of $Z^{[2]}_1$ and $Z^{[2]}_2$ change, their mean and variance will at least stay same mean zero and variance one. Or, not necessarily mean zero and variance one, but whatever value is governed by $\beta^{[2]}$ and $\gamma^{[2]}$. Which, if the neural networks chooses, can force it to be mean zero and variance one. Or, really, any other mean and variance. But what this does is, it limits the amount to which updating the parameters in the earlier layers can affect the distribution of values that the third layer now sees and therefore has to learn on. <strong>And so, batch norm reduces the problem of the input values changing, it really causes these values to become more stable, so that the later layers of the neural network has more firm ground to stand on. And even though the input distribution changes a bit, it changes less, and what this does is, even as the earlier layers keep learning, the amounts that this forces the later layers to adapt to as early as layer changes is reduced or, if you will, it weakens the coupling between what the early layers parameters has to do and what the later layers parameters have to do. And so it allows each layer of the network to learn by itself, a little bit more independently of other layers, and this has the effect of speeding up of learning in the whole network</strong>.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/23.png" alt=""><br>So I hope this gives some better intuition, but the takeaway is that batch norm means that, especially from the perspective of one of the later layers of the neural network, <strong>the earlier layers don’t get to shift around as much, because they’re constrained to have the same mean and variance. And so this makes the job of learning on the later layers easier. It turns out batch norm has a second effect, it has a slight regularization effect</strong>. So one non-intuitive thing of a batch norm is that each mini-batch, I will say mini-batch X_t, has the values Z_t, has the values Z_l, scaled by <strong>the mean and variance computed on just that one mini-batch</strong>. Now, because the mean and variance computed on just that mini-batch as opposed to computed on the entire data set, that mean and variance has a little bit of noise in it, because it’s computed just on your mini-batch of, say, 64, or 128, or maybe 256 or larger training examples. <strong>So because the mean and variance is a little bit noisy because it’s estimated with just a relatively small sample of data</strong>, the scaling process, going from Z_l to Z_2_l, that process is a little bit noisy as well, because it’s computed, using a slightly noisy mean and variance. So similar to dropout, it adds some noise to each hidden layer’s activations. The way dropout has noises, it takes a hidden unit and it multiplies it by zero with some probability. And multiplies it by one with some probability. And so your dropout has multiple of noise because it’s multiplied by zero or one, whereas batch norm has multiples of noise because of scaling by the standard deviation, as well as additive noise because it’s subtracting the mean. <strong>Well, here the estimates of the mean and the standard deviation are noisy. And so, similar to dropout, batch norm therefore has a slight regularization effect. Because by adding noise to the hidden units, it’s forcing the downstream hidden units not to rely too much on any one hidden unit. And so similar to dropout, it adds noise to the hidden layers and therefore has a very slight regularization effect. Because the noise added is quite small, this is not a huge regularization effect, and you might choose to use batch norm together with dropout, and you might use batch norm together with dropouts if you want the more powerful regularization effect of dropout</strong>. </p>
<p>And maybe one other slightly non-intuitive effect is that, if you use a bigger mini-batch size, right, so if you use use a mini-batch size of, say, 512 instead of 64, by using a larger mini-batch size, you’re reducing this noise and therefore also reducing this regularization effect. <strong>So that’s one strange property of dropout which is that by using a bigger mini-batch size, you reduce the regularization effect. Having said this, I wouldn’t really use batch norm as a regularizer, that’s really not the intent of batch norm, but sometimes it has this extra intended or unintended effect on your learning algorithm. But, really, don’t turn to batch norm as a regularization. Use it as a way to normalize your hidden units activations and therefore speed up learning. And I think the regularization is an almost unintended side effect</strong>. </p>
<p>So I hope that gives you better intuition about what batch norm is doing. Before we wrap up the discussion on batch norm, <strong>there’s one more detail I want to make sure you know, which is that batch norm handles data one mini-batch at a time. It computes mean and variances on mini-batches. So at test time, you try and make predictors, try and evaluate the neural network, you might not have a mini-batch of examples, you might be processing one single example at the time. So, at test time you need to do something slightly differently to make sure your predictions make sense. Like in the next and final video on batch norm</strong>, let’s talk over the details of what you need to do in order to take your neural network trained using batch norm to make predictions.</p>
<h3 id="04-batch-norm-at-test-time"><a href="#04-batch-norm-at-test-time" class="headerlink" title="04_batch-norm-at-test-time"></a>04_batch-norm-at-test-time</h3><p>Batch norm processes your data one mini batch at a time, but the test time you might need to process the examples one at a time. Let’s see how you can adapt your network to do that. </p>
<p>Recall that during training, here are the equations you’d use to implement batch norm. <strong>Within a single mini batch</strong>, you’d sum over that mini batch of the ZI values to compute the mean. So here, you’re just summing over the examples in one mini batch. I’m using M to denote the number of examples in the mini batch not in the whole training set. Then, you compute the variance and then you compute Z norm by scaling by the mean and standard deviation with Epsilon added for numerical stability. And then Z total is taking Z norm and rescaling by gamma and beta. So, notice that mu and sigma squared which you need for this scaling calculation are computed on the entire mini batch. <strong>But the test time you might not have a mini batch of 6428 or 2056 examples to process at the same time. So, you need some different way of coming up with $\mu$ and $\sigma$ squared. And if you have just one example, taking the mean and variance of that one example, doesn’t make sense.</strong><br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/24.png" alt=""><br>So what’s actually done? In order to apply your neural network and test time is to come up with some separate estimate of mu and sigma squared. <strong>And in typical implementations of batch norm, what you do is estimate this using a exponentially weighted average where the average is across the mini batches.</strong> So, to be very concrete here’s what I mean. Let’s pick some layer L and let’s say you’re going through mini batches X1, X2 together with the corresponding values of Y and so on. So, when training on X1 for that layer L, you get some mu L. And in fact, I’m going to write this as mu for the first mini batch and that layer. And then when you train on the second mini batch for that layer and that mini batch,you end up with some second value of mu. And then for the fourth mini batch in this hidden layer, you end up with some third value for mu. So just as we saw how to use a exponentially weighted average to compute the mean of Theta one, Theta two, Theta three when you were trying to compute a exponentially weighted average of the current temperature, you would do that to keep track of what’s the latest average value of this mean vector you’ve seen. So that exponentially weighted average becomes your estimate for what the mean of the Zs is for that hidden layer and similarly, you use an exponentially weighted average to keep track of these values of sigma squared that you see on the first mini batch in that layer, sigma square that you see on second mini batch and so on. So you keep a running average of the mu and the sigma squared that you’re seeing for each layer as you train the neural network across different mini batches. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/25.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then finally at test time, what you do is in place of this equation(Tip: the equations in green color above the slide), you would just compute $Z$ norm using whatever value your $Z$ have, and using your exponentially weighted average of the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ square whatever was the latest value you have to do the scaling here. And then you would compute $\tilde{Z}$ on your one test example using that $Z_{norm}$ that we just computed on the left and using the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ parameters that you have learned during your neural network training process. </p>
<p><strong>So the takeaway from this is that during training time $\mu$ and $\sigma$ squared are computed on an entire mini batch of say 64, 28 or some number of examples. But that test time, you might need to process a single example at a time. So, the way to do that is to estimate $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ from your training set and there are many ways to do that. You could in theory run your whole training set through your final network to get $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$. But in practice, what people usually do is implement and exponentially weighted average where you just keep track of the $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ values you’re seeing during training and use and exponentially the weighted average, also sometimes called the running average, to just get a rough estimate of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ and then you use those values of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ that test time to do the scale and you need the head and unit values Z</strong>. </p>
<p>In practice, this process is <strong>pretty robust</strong> to the exact way you used to estimate mu and sigma squared. So, I wouldn’t worry too much about exactly how you do this and <strong>if you’re using a deep learning framework, they’ll usually have some default way to estimate the mu and sigma squared that should work reasonably well as well.</strong> But in practice, any reasonable way to estimate the mean and variance of your head and unit values Z should work fine at test. </p>
<p>So, that’s it for batch norm and using it. I think you’ll be able to train much deeper networks and get your learning algorithm to run much more quickly. Before we wrap up for this week, I want to share with you some thoughts on deep learning frameworks as well. Let’s start to talk about that in the next video. </p>
<h2 id="03-multi-class-classification"><a href="#03-multi-class-classification" class="headerlink" title="03_multi-class-classification"></a>03_multi-class-classification</h2><h3 id="01-softmax-regression"><a href="#01-softmax-regression" class="headerlink" title="01_softmax-regression"></a>01_softmax-regression</h3><p>So far, the classification examples we’ve talked about have used binary classification, where you had two possible labels, 0 or 1. Is it a cat, is it not a cat? What if we have multiple possible classes? There’s a generalization of logistic regression called Softmax regression. Let’s you make predictions where you’re trying to recognize one of C or one of multiple classes, rather than just recognize two classes. Let’s take a look. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/26.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say that instead of just recognizing cats you want to recognize cats, dogs, and baby chicks. So I’m going to call cats class 1, dogs class 2, baby chicks class 3. And if none of the above, then there’s an other or a none of the above class, which I’m going to call class 0. So here’s an example of the images and the classes they belong to. That’s a picture of a baby chick, so the class is 3. Cats is class 1, dog is class 2, I guess that’s a koala, so that’s none of the above, so that is class 0, class 3 and so on. So the notation we’re going to use is, I’m going to use capital C to denote the number of classes you’re trying to categorize your inputs into. And in this case, you have four possible classes, including the other or the none of the above class. So when you have four classes, the numbers indexing your classes would be 0 through capital C minus one. So in other words, that would be zero, one, two or three. In this case, we’re going to build a new XY, where the upper layer has four, or in this case the variable capital alphabet C upward units. So N, the number of units upper layer which is layer L is going to equal to 4 or in general this is going to equal to C. And what we want is for the number of units in the upper layer to tell us what is the probability of each of these four classes. So the first node here is supposed to output, or we want it to output the probability that is the other class, given the input x, this will output probability there’s a cat. Give an x, this will output probability as a dog. Give an x, that will output the probability. I’m just going to abbreviate baby chick to baby C, given the input x. <strong>So here, the output labels $y$ hat is going to be a four by one dimensional vector, because it now has to output four numbers, giving you these four probabilities. And because probabilities should sum to one, the four numbers in the output $\hat{y}$, they should sum to one.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/27.png" alt=""><br>The standard model for getting your network to do this uses what’s called <strong>a Softmax layer</strong>, and the output layer in order to generate these outputs. Then write down the map, then you can come back and get some intuition about what the Softmax there is doing. So in the final layer of the neural network, you are going to compute as usual the linear part of the layers. So z, capital L, that’s the z variable for the final layer. So remember this is layer capital L. So as usual you compute that as wL times the activation of the previous layer plus the biases for that final layer. Now having computer z, you now need to apply what’s called the Softmax activation function. So that activation function is a bit unusual for the Softmax layer, but this is what it does. First, we’re going to computes a temporary variable, which we’re going to call t, which is e to the z L. So this is a part element-wise. So zL here, in our example, zL is going to be four by one. This is a four dimensional vector. So t Itself e to the zL, that’s an element wise exponentiation. T will also be a 4 by 1 dimensional vector. Then the output aL, is going to be basically the vector t will normalized to sum to 1. So aL is going to be e to the zL divided by sum from J equal 1 through 4, because we have four classes of t substitute i. So in other words we’re saying that aL is also a four by one vector, and the i element of this four dimensional vector. Let’s write that, aL substitute i that’s going to be equal to ti over sum of ti, okay? In case this math isn’t clear, we’ll do an example in a minute that will make this clearer. So in case this math isn’t clear, let’s go through a specific example that will make this clearer. </p>
<p>Let’s say that your computer $Z^{[L]}$, and $Z^{[L]}$ is a four dimensional vector, let’s say is 5, 2, -1, 3. What we’re going to do is use this element-wise exponentiation to compute this vector t. So t is going to be e to the 5, e to the 2, e to the -1, e to the 3. And if you plug that in the calculator, these are the values you get. E to the 5 is 1484, e squared is about 7.4, e to the -1 is 0.4, and e cubed is 20.1. And so, the way we go from the vector t to the vector aL is just to normalize these entries to sum to one. So if you sum up the elements of t, if you just add up those 4 numbers you get 176.3. So finally, aL is just going to be this vector t, as a vector, divided by 176.3. So for example, this first node here, this will output e to the 5 divided by 176.3. And that turns out to be 0.842. So saying that, for this image, if this is the value of z you get, the chance of it being called zero is 84.2%. And then the next nodes outputs e squared over 176.3, that turns out to be 0.042, so this is 4.2% chance. The next one is e to -1 over that, which is 0.042. And the final one is e cubed over that, which is 0.114. So it is 11.4% chance that this is class number three, which is the baby C class, right? So there’s a chance of it being class zero, class one, class two, class three. So the output of the neural network aL, this is also y hat. This is a 4 by 1 vector where the elements of this 4 by 1 vector are going to be these four numbers. Then we just compute it. So this algorithm takes the vector zL and is four probabilities that sum to 1. And if we summarize what we just did to math from zL to aL, this whole computation confusing exponentiation to get this temporary variable t and then normalizing, we can summarize this into a Softmax activation function and say aL equals the activation function g applied to the vector zL. The unusual thing about this particular activation function is that, this activation function g, it takes a input a 4 by 1 vector and it outputs a 4 by 1 vector. <strong>So previously, our activation functions used to take in a single row value input. So for example, the sigmoid and the value activation functions input the real number and output a real number. The unusual thing about the Softmax activation function is, because it needs to normalized across the different possible outputs, and needs to take a vector and puts in outputs of vector.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/28.png" alt=""><br>So what other things that a Softmax cross layer can represent, I’m going to show you some examples where you have inputs x1, x2. And these feed directly to a Softmax layer that has three or four, or more output nodes that then output y hat. So I’m going to show you a new network with no hidden layer, and all it does is compute z1 equals w1 times the input x plus b. And then the output a1, or y hat is just the Softmax activation function applied to z1. So in this neural network with no hidden layers, it should give you a sense of the types of things a Softmax function can represent. So here’s one example with just raw inputs x1 and x2. A Softmax layer with C equals 3 upper classes can represent this type of decision boundaries. Notice this kind of several linear decision boundaries, but this allows it to separate out the data into three classes. And in this diagram, what we did was we actually took the training set that’s kind of shown in this figure and train the Softmax cross fire with the upper labels on the data. And then the color on this plot shows fresh holding the upward of the Softmax cross fire, and coloring in the input base on which one of the three outputs have the highest probability. So we can maybe we kind of see that this is like a generalization of logistic regression with sort of linear decision boundaries, but with more than two classes [INAUDIBLE] class 0, 1, the class could be 0, 1, or 2. Here’s another example of the decision boundary that a Softmax cross fire represents when three normal datasets with three classes. And here’s another one, rIght, so this is a, but one intuition is that the decision boundary between any two classes will be more linear. That’s why you see for example that decision boundary between the yellow and the various classes, that’s the linear boundary where the purple and red linear in boundary between the purple and yellow and other linear decision boundary. But able to use these different linear functions in order to separate the space into three classes. Let’s look at some examples with more classes. So it’s an example with C equals 4, so that the green class and Softmax can continue to represent these types of linear decision boundaries between multiple classes. So here’s one more example with C equals 5 classes, and here’s one last example with C equals 6. So this shows the type of things the Softmax crossfire can do when there is no hidden layer of class, even much deeper neural network with x and then some hidden units, and then more hidden units, and so on. Then you can learn even more complex non-linear decision boundaries to separate out multiple different classes. </p>
<p>So I hope this gives you a sense of what a Softmax layer or the Softmax activation function in the neural network can do. In the next video, let’s take a look at how you can train a neural network that uses a Softmax layer. </p>
<h3 id="02-training-a-softmax-classifier"><a href="#02-training-a-softmax-classifier" class="headerlink" title="02_training-a-softmax-classifier"></a>02_training-a-softmax-classifier</h3><p>In the last video, you learned about the softmax, the softmax activation function. In this video, you deepen your understanding of softmax classification, and also learn how the training model that uses a softmax layer. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/29.png" alt=""><br>Recall our earlier example where the output layer computes z[L] as follows. So we have four classes, $C = 4$ then $Z^{[L]}$ can be (4,1) dimensional vector and we said we compute t which is this temporary variable that performs element y’s exponentiation. And then finally, if the activation function for your output layer, g[L] is the softmax activation function, then your outputs will be this. It’s basically taking the temporarily variable t and normalizing it to sum to 1. So this then becomes a(L). So you notice that in the z vector, the biggest element was 5, and the biggest probability ends up being this first probability. The name softmax comes from contrasting it to what’s called a hard max which would have taken the vector Z and matched it to this vector. So hard max function will look at the elements of Z and just put a 1 in the position of the biggest element of Z and then 0s everywhere else. And so this is a very hard max where the biggest element gets a output of 1 and everything else gets an output of 0. Whereas in contrast, a softmax is a more gentle mapping from Z to these probabilities. So, I’m not sure if this is a great name but at least, that was the intuition behind why we call it a softmax, all this in contrast to the hard max. And one thing I didn’t really show but had alluded to is that softmax regression or the softmax identification function generalizes the logistic activation function to C classes rather than just two classes. And it turns out that if C = 2, then softmax with C = 2 essentially reduces to logistic regression. And I’m not going to prove this in this video but the rough outline for the proof is that if C = 2 and if you apply softmax, then the output layer, a[L], will output two numbers if C = 2, so maybe it outputs 0.842 and 0.158, right? And these two numbers always have to sum to 1. And because these two numbers always have to sum to 1, they’re actually redundant. And maybe you don’t need to bother to compute two of them, maybe you just need to compute one of them. And it turns out that the way you end up computing that number reduces to the way that logistic regression is computing its single output. So that wasn’t much of a proof but the takeaway from this is that softmax regression is a generalization of logistic regression to more than two classes. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/30.png" alt=""><br>Now let’s look at how you would actually train a neural network with a softmax output layer. So in particular, let’s define the loss functions you use to train your neural network. Let’s take an example. Let’s see of an example in your training set where the target output, the ground true label is 0 1 0 0. So the example from the previous video, this means that this is an image of a cat because it falls into Class 1. And now let’s say that your neural network is currently outputting y hat equals, so y hat would be a vector probability is equal to sum to 1. 0.1, 0.4, so you can check that sums to 1, and this is going to be a[L]. So the neural network’s not doing very well in this example because this is actually a cat and assigned only a 20% chance that this is a cat. So didn’t do very well in this example. So what’s the last function you would want to use to train this neural network? In softmax classification, they’ll ask me to produce this negative sum of j=1 through 4. And it’s really sum from 1 to C in the general case. We’re going to just use 4 here, of yj log y hat of j. So let’s look at our single example above to better understand what happens. Notice that in this example, y1 = y3 = y4 = 0 because those are 0s and only y2 = 1. So if you look at this summation, all of the terms with 0 values of yj were equal to 0. And the only term you’re left with is -y2 log y hat 2, because we use sum over the indices of j, all the terms will end up 0, except when j is equal to 2. And because y2 = 1, this is just -log y hat 2. So what this means is that, if your learning algorithm is trying to make this small because you use gradient descent to try to reduce the loss on your training set. Then the only way to make this small is to make this small. And the only way to do that is to make y hat 2 as big as possible. And these are probabilities, so they can never be bigger than 1. But this kind of makes sense because x for this example is the picture of a cat, then you want that output probability to be as big as possible. So more generally, what this loss function does is it looks at whatever is the ground true class in your training set, and it tries to make the corresponding probability of that class as high as possible. If you’re familiar with maximum likelihood estimation statistics, this turns out to be a form of maximum likelyhood estimation. But if you don’t know what that means, don’t worry about it. The intuition we just talked about will suffice. Now this is the loss on a single training example. How about the cost J on the entire training set. So, the class of setting of the parameters and so on, of all the ways and biases, you define that as pretty much what you’d guess, sum of your entire training sets are the loss, your learning algorithms predictions are summed over your training samples. And so, what you do is use gradient descent in order to try to minimize this class.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/31.png" alt=""><br>Finally, one more implementation detail. Notice that because C is equal to 4, y is a 4 by 1 vector, and y hat is also a 4 by 1 vector. So if you’re using a vectorized limitation, the matrix capital Y is going to be y(1), y(2), through y(m), stacked horizontally. And so for example, if this example up here is your first training example then the first column of this matrix Y will be 0 1 0 0 and then maybe the second example is a dog, maybe the third example is a none of the above, and so on. And then this matrix Y will end up being a 4 by m dimensional matrix. And similarly, Y hat will be y hat 1 stacked up horizontally going through y hat m, so this is actually y hat 1. All the output on the first training example then y hat will these 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, and 0.4, and so on. And y hat itself will also be 4 by m dimensional matrix. Finally, let’s take a look at how you’d implement gradient descent when you have a softmax output layer. So this output layer will compute z[L] which is C by 1 in our example, 4 by 1 and then you apply the softmax attribution function to get a[L], or y hat. And then that in turn allows you to compute the loss. So with talks about how to implement the forward propagation step of a neural network to get these outputs and to compute that loss. How about the back propagation step, or gradient descent? Turns out that the key step or the key equation you need to initialize back prop is this expression, that the derivative with respect to z at the loss layer, this turns out, you can compute this y hat, the 4 by 1 vector, minus y, the 4 by 1 vector. So you notice that all of these are going to be 4 by 1 vectors when you have 4 classes and C by 1 in the more general case. And so this going by our usual definition of what is dz, this is the partial derivative of the class function with respect to z[L]. If you are an expert in calculus, you can derive this yourself. Or if you’re an expert in calculus, you can try to derive this yourself, but using this formula will also just work fine, if you have a need to implement this from scratch. With this, you can then compute dz[L] and then sort of start off the back prop process to compute all the derivatives you need throughout your neural network. But it turns out that in this week’s primary exercise, we’ll start to use one of the deep learning program frameworks and for those primary frameworks, usually it turns out you just need to focus on getting the forward prop right. And so long as you specify it as a primary framework, the forward prop pass, the primary framework will figure out how to do back prop, how to do the backward pass for you. So this expression is worth keeping in mind for if you ever need to implement softmax regression, or softmax classification from scratch. Although you won’t actually need this in this week’s primary exercise because the primary framework you use will take care of this derivative computation for you. </p>
<p>So that’s it for softmax classification, with it you can now implement learning algorithms to characterized inputs into not just one of two classes, but one of C different classes. Next, I want to show you some of the deep learning programming frameworks which can make you much more efficient in terms of implementing deep learning algorithms. Let’s go on to the next video to discuss that. </p>

<h2 id="04-introduction-to-programming-frameworks"><a href="#04-introduction-to-programming-frameworks" class="headerlink" title="04_introduction-to-programming-frameworks"></a>04_introduction-to-programming-frameworks</h2><p>You’ve learned to implement deep learning algorithms more or less from scratch using Python and NumPY. And I’m glad you did that because I wanted you to understand what these deep learning algorithms are really doing. But you find unless you implement more complex models, such as convolutional neural networks or recurring neural networks, or as you start to implement very large models that is increasingly not practical, at least for most people, is not practical to implement everything yourself from scratch. Fortunately, there are now many good deep learning software frameworks that can help you implement these models. To make an analogy, I think that hopefully you understand how to do a matrix multiplication and you should be able to implement how to code, to multiply two matrices yourself. But as you build very large applications, you’ll probably not want to implement your own matrix multiplication function but instead you want to call a numerical linear algebra library that could do it more efficiently for you. But this still helps that you understand how multiplying two matrices work. So I think deep learning has now matured to that point where it’s actually more practical you’ll be more efficient doing some things with some of the deep learning frameworks. So let’s take a look at the frameworks out there. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/03_hyperparameter-tuning-batch-normalization-and-programming-frameworks/32.png" alt=""><br>Today, there are many deep learning frameworks that makes it easy for you to implement neural networks, and here are some of the leading ones. Each of these frameworks has a dedicated user and developer community and I think each of these frameworks is a credible choice for some subset of applications. There are lot of people writing articles comparing these deep learning frameworks and how well these deep learning frameworks changes. And because these frameworks are often evolving and getting better month to month, I’ll leave you to do a few internet searches yourself, if you want to see the arguments on the pros and cons of some of these frameworks. But I think many of these frameworks are evolving and getting better very rapidly. So rather than too strongly endorsing any of these frameworks I want to share with you the criteria I would recommend you use to choose frameworks. One important criteria is the ease of programming, and that means both developing the neural network and iterating on it as well as deploying it for production, for actual use, by thousands or millions or maybe hundreds of millions of users, depending on what you’re trying to do. A second important criteria is running speeds, especially training on large data sets, some frameworks will let you run and train your neural network more efficiently than others. And then, one criteria that people don’t often talk about but I think is important is whether or not the framework is truly open. And for a framework to be truly open, it needs not only to be open source but I think it needs good governance as well. Unfortunately, in the software industry some companies have a history of open sourcing software but maintaining single corporation control of the software. And then over some number of years, as people start to use the software, some companies have a history of gradually closing off what was open source, or perhaps moving functionality into their own proprietary cloud services. So one thing I pay a bit of attention to is how much you trust that the framework will remain open source for a long time rather than just being under the control of a single company, which for whatever reason may choose to close it off in the future even if the software is currently released under open source. But at least in the short term depending on your preferences of language, whether you prefer Python or Java or C++ or something else, and depending on what application you’re working on, whether this can be division or natural language processing or online advertising or something else, I think multiple of these frameworks could be a good choice. So that said on programming frameworks by providing a higher level of abstraction than just a numerical linear algebra library, any of these program frameworks can make you more efficient as you develop machine learning applications.</p>
<h3 id="02-tensorflow"><a href="#02-tensorflow" class="headerlink" title="02_tensorflow"></a>02_tensorflow</h3><p>Welcome to the last video for this week. There are many great, deep learning programming frameworks. One of them is TensorFlow. I’m excited to help you start to learn to use TensorFlow. What I want to do in this video is show you the basic structure of a TensorFlow program, and then leave you to practice, learn more details, and practice them yourself in this week’s problem exercise. This week’s problem exercise will take some time to do so please be sure to leave some extra time to do it. </p>
<p>As a motivating problem, let’s say that you have some cost function J that you want to minimize. And for this example, I’m going to use this highly simple cost function J(w) = w squared- 10w + 25. So that’s the cost function. You might notice that this function is actually (w- 5) squared. If you expand out this quadratic, you get the expression above, and so the value of w that minimizes this is w = 5. But let’s say we didn’t know that, and you just have this function. Let’s see how you can implement something in TensorFlow to minimize this. Because a very similar structure of program can be used to train neural networks where you can have some complicated cost function J(w, b) depending on all the parameters of your neural network. And the, similarly, you’ll be able to use TensorFlow so automatically try to find values of w and b that minimize this cost function. But let’s start with the simpler example on the left. So, I’m running Python in my Jupyter notebook and to start up TensorFlow, you import numpy as np and it’s idiomatic to use import tensorflow as tf. Next, let me define the parameter w. So in TensorFlow, you’re going to use tf.Variable to define a parameter. Dtype=tf.float32. And then let’s define the cost function. So remember the cost function was w squared- 10w + 25. So let me use tf.add. So I’m going to have w squared + tf.multiply. So the second term was -10.w. And then I’m going to add that 25. So let me put another tf.add over there. So that defines the cost J that we had. And then, I’m going to write train = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer. Let’s use a learning rate of 0.01 and the goal is to minimize the cost. And finally, the following few lines are quite idiomatic. Init = tf.global_variables_initializer and then session = tf.Sessions. So it starts a TensorFlow session. Session.run init to initialize global variables. And then, for TensorFlow’s evaluative variable, we’re going to use sess.run w. We haven’t done anything yet. So with this line above, initialize w to zero and define a cost function. We define train to be our learning algorithm which uses a GradientDescentOptimizer to minimize the cost function. But we haven’t actually run the learning algorithm yet, so session.run, we evaluate w, and let me print(session.run(w). So if we run that, it evaluates w to be equal to 0 because we haven’t run anything yet. Now, let’s do session.run train. So what this will do is run one step of GradientDescent. And then let’s evaluate the value of w after one step of GradientDescent and print that. So we do that of the one set of GradientDescent, w is now 0.1. Let’s now run 1000 iterations of GradientDescent so .run(train). And lets then print(session.run w). So this would run a 1,000 iterations of GradientDescent, and at the end w ends up being 4.9999. Remember, we said that we’re minimizing w- 5 squared so the absolute value of w is 5 and it got very close to this. So hope this gives you a sense of the broad structure of a TensorFlow program. And as you do the following exercise and play with more TensorFlow course yourself, some of these functions that I’m using here will become more familiar. </p>
<p>Some things to notice about this, <strong>w is the parameter</strong> which I optimize so we’re going to declare that as a variable. And notice that all <strong>we had to do was define a cost function</strong> using these add and multiply and so on functions. And TensorFlow knows automatically how to take derivatives with respect to the add and multiply as was other functions. Which is why you only had to implement basically four prop and it can figure out how to do the back problem or the grading computation. Because that’s already built in to the add and multiply as well as the squaring functions. By the way, in cases notation seems really ugly, TensorFlow actually has overloaded the computation for the usual plus, minus, and so on. So you could also just write this nicer format for the cost and comment that out and rerun this and get the same result. <strong>So once w is declared to be a TensorFlow variable, the squaring, multiplication, adding, and subtraction operations are overloaded</strong>. So you don’t need to use this uglier syntax that I had above. </p>
<p>Now, there’s just one more feature of TensorFlow that I want to show you, which is this example minimize a fix function of w. One of the function you want to minimize is the function of your training set. So whether you have some training data, x and when you’re training a neural network the training data x can change. So how do you get training data into a TensorFlow program? So I’m going to define t and x which is think of this as train a relevant training data or really the training data with both x and y, but we only have x in this example. So just going to define x with placeholder and it’s going to be a type float32 and let’s make this a [3,1] array. And what I’m going to do is whereas the cost here have fixed coefficients in front of the three terms in this quadratic was 1 times w squared- 10<em>w + 25. We could turn these numbers 1- 10 and 25 into data. So what I’m going to do is replace the cost with cost = x[0][0]</em>w squared + x[1][0]*w + x[2][0]. Well, times 1. So now x becomes sort of like data that controls the coefficients of this quadratic function. And this placeholder function tells TensorFlow that x is something that you provide the values for later. So let’s define another array, coefficient = np.array, [1.], [-10.] and yes, the loss value was [25.]. So that’s going to be the data that we’re going to plug into x. So finally we need a way to get this array coefficients into the variable x and the syntax to do that is just doing the training step. That the values for will need to be provided for x, I’m going to set here, feed_dict = x:coefficients, And I’m going to change this, I’m going to copy and paste put that there as well. All right, hopefully, I didn’t have any syntax errors. Let’s try re-running this and we get the same results hopefully as before. And now, if you want to change the coefficients of this quadratic function, let’s say you take this [-10.] and change it to 20, [-20]. And let’s change this to 100. So this is now a function x- 10 squared. And if I re-run this, hopefully, I find that the value that minimizes x- 10 squared is w = 10. Let’s see, cool, great and we get w very close to 10 after running 1,000 integrations of GradientDescent. So what you see more of when you do that from exercise is that a placeholder in TensorFlow is a variable whose value you assign later. And this is a convenient way to get your training data into the cost function. And the way you get your data into the cost function is with this syntax when you’re running a training iteration to use the feed_dict to set x to be equal to the coefficients here. And if you are doing mini batch GradientDescent where on each iteration, you need to plug in a different mini batch, then on different iterations you use the feed_dict to feed in different subsets of your training sets. Different mini batches into where your cost function is expecting to see data. So hopefully this gives you a sense of what TensorFlow can do. And the thing that makes this so powerful is all you need to do is specify how to compute the cost function. And then, it takes derivatives and it can apply a gradient optimizer or an add-on optimizer or some other optimizer with just pretty much one or two lines of codes. </p>
<p>So here’s the code again. I’ve cleaned this up just a little bit. And in case some of these functions or variables seem a little bit mysterious to use, they will become more familiar after you’ve practiced with it a couple times by working through their problem exercise. Just one last thing I want to mention. These three lines of code are quite idiomatic in TensorFlow, and what some programmers will do is use this alternative format. Which basically does the same thing. Set session to tf.Session() to start the session, and then use the session to run init, and then use the session to evaluate, say, w and then print the result. But this with construction is used in a number of TensorFlow programs as well. It more or less means the same thing as the thing on the left. <strong>But the with command in Python is a little bit better at cleaning up in cases an error in exception while executing this inner loop</strong>. So you see this is the following exercise as well. So what is this code really doing? Let’s focus on this equation. <strong>The heart of a TensorFlow program is something to compute at cost, and then TensorFlow automatically figures out the derivatives in how to minimize that costs. So what this equation or what this line of code is doing is allowing TensorFlow to construct a computation draft</strong>. And a computation draft does the following, it takes x[0][0], it takes w and then it goes w gets squared. And then x[0][0] gets multiplied with w squared, so you have x[0][0]<em>w squared, and so on, right? And eventually, you know, this gets built up to compute this xw, x[0][0]</em>w squared + x[1][0]<em>w + and so on. And so eventually, you get the cost function. And so the last term to be added would be x [2][0] where it gets added to be the cost. I won’t write other format for the cost. *</em>And the nice thing about TensorFlow is that by implementing basically four prop applications through this computation draft, the computed cost, TensorFlow already has that built in. All the necessary backward functions. So remember how training a deep neural network has a set of forward functions instead of backward functions. Programming frameworks like Tensor Flow have already built-in the necessary backward functions. Which is why by using the built-in functions to compute the forward function, it can automatically do the backward functions as well to implement back propagation through even very complicated functions and compute derivatives for you. So that’s why you don’t need to explicitly implement back prop. This is one of the things that makes the programming frameworks help you become really efficient.** If you look at the TensorFlow documentation, I just want to point out that the TensorFlow documentation uses a slightly different notation than I did for drawing the computation draft. So it uses x[0][0] w. And then, rather than writing the value, like w squared, the TensorFlow documentation tends to just write the operation. So this would be a, square operation, and then these two get combined in the multiplication operation and so on. And then, a final note, I guess that would be an addition operation where you add x to 0 to find the final value. So for the purposes of this class, I thought that this notation for the computation draft would be easier for you to understand. But if you look at the TensorFlow documentation, if you look at the computation drafts in the documentation, you see this alternative convention where the notes are labeled with the operations rather than with the value. But both of these representations represent basically the same computation draft. </p>
<p>And there are a lot of things that you can with just one line of code in programming frameworks. For example, if you don’t want to use GradientDescent, but instead you want to use the add-on Optimizer by changing this line of code, you can very quickly swap it, swap in a better optimization algorithm. So all the modern deep learning programming framework support things like this and makes it really easy for you to code up even pretty complex neural networks. </p>
<p>So I hope this is helpful for giving you a sense of the typical structure of a TensorFlow program. </p>
<p>To recap the material from this week, you saw how to systematically organize the hyper parameter search process. We also talked about batch normalization and how you can use that to speed up training of your neural networks. And finally, we talked about programming frameworks of deep learning. There are many great programming frameworks. And we had this last video focusing on TensorFlow. With that, I hope you enjoyed this week’s programming exercise and that helps you gain even more familiarity with these ideas. </p>

<h1 id="Optimization-Methods"><a href="#Optimization-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Optimization Methods"></a>Optimization Methods</h1><p>Until now, you’ve always used Gradient Descent to update the parameters and minimize the cost. In this notebook, you will learn more advanced optimization methods that can speed up learning and perhaps even get you to a better final value for the cost function. Having a good optimization algorithm can be the difference between waiting days vs. just a few hours to get a good result.</p>
<p>Gradient descent goes “downhill” on a cost function $J$. Think of it as trying to do this:</p>

<caption><center> <u> **Figure 1** </u>: ** : Minimizing the cost is like finding the lowest point in a hilly landscape()**<br> At each step of the training, you update your parameters following a certain direction to try to get to the lowest possible point.</center></caption>

<h2 id="1-Gradient-Descent"><a href="#1-Gradient-Descent" class="headerlink" title="1. Gradient Descent"></a>1. Gradient Descent</h2><p>A simple optimization method in machine learning is gradient descent (GD). When you take gradient steps with respect to all $m$ examples on each step, it is also called Batch Gradient Descent.</p>
<p>Warm-up exercise: Implement the gradient descent update rule. The gradient descent rule is, for $l=1,…,L$:<br>$$W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \alpha \text{ } dW^{[l]} \tag{1}$$<br>$$b^{[l]} = b^{[l]} - \alpha \text{ } db^{[l]} \tag{2}$$</p>

<p>A variant of this is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which is equivalent to mini-batch gradient descent where each mini-batch has just 1 example. The update rule that you have just implemented does not change. What changes is that you would be computing gradients on just one training example at a time, rather than on the whole training set. The code examples below illustrate the difference between stochastic gradient descent and (batch) gradient descent.</p>

<p>In Stochastic Gradient Descent, you use only 1 training example before updating the gradients. When the training set is large, SGD can be faster. But the parameters will “oscillate” toward the minimum rather than converge smoothly. Here is an illustration of this:</p>
<img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/week2/images/2.png" >

            **Figure 1** 
        </u> 
            **: SGD vs GD**
        <br>
         “+” denotes a minimum of the cost. SGD leads to many oscillations to reach convergence. But each step is a lot faster to compute for SGD than for GD, as it uses only one training example (vs. the whole batch for GD).
    </center>
</caption>




<p><strong>Note</strong> also that implementing SGD requires 3 for-loops in total: </p>
<ol>
<li>Over the number of iterations </li>
<li>Over the m training examples </li>
<li>Over the layers (to update all parameters, from ($W^{[1]}$,$b^{[1]}$) to ($W^{[L]}$,$b^{[L]}$)</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, you’ll often get faster results if you do not use neither the whole training set, nor only one training example, to perform each update. Mini-batch gradient descent uses an intermediate number of examples for each step. With mini-batch gradient descent, you loop over the mini-batches instead of looping over individual training examples.</p>

<p><strong>What you should remember:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The difference between gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent is the number of examples you use to perform one update step. </li>
<li>You have to tune a learning rate hyperparameter α. </li>
<li>With a well-turned mini-batch size, usually it outperforms either gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent (particularly when the training set is large).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-Mini-Batch-Gradient-descent"><a href="#2-Mini-Batch-Gradient-descent" class="headerlink" title="2. Mini-Batch Gradient descent"></a>2. Mini-Batch Gradient descent</h2><p>Let’s learn how to build mini-batches from the training set $(X, Y)$.</p>
<p>There are two steps: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shuffle</strong>: Create a shuffled version of the training set $(X, Y)$ as shown below. Each column of $X$ and $Y$ represents a training example. Note that the random shuffling is done synchronously between $X$ and $Y$. Such that after the shuffling the ith column of $X$ is the example corresponding to the ith label in $Y$. The shuffling step ensures that examples will be split randomly into different mini-batches.</li>
</ul>
<img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/week2/images/4.png" style="width:600px;height:400px;">



<ul>
<li><strong>Partition</strong>: Partition the shuffled $(X, Y)$ into mini-batches of size <code>mini_batch_size</code> (here 64). Note that the number of training examples is not always divisible by <code>mini_batch_size</code>. The last mini batch might be smaller, but you don’t need to worry about this. When the final mini-batch is smaller than the full <code>mini_batch_size</code>, it will look like this:</li>
</ul>
<img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/week2/images/5.png" >


<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement <code>random_mini_batches</code>. We coded the shuffling part for you. To help you with the partitioning step, we give you the following code that selects the indexes for the 1st and 2nd mini-batches:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">first_mini_batch_X = shuffled_X[:, <span class="number">0</span> : mini_batch_size]</span><br><span class="line">second_mini_batch_X = shuffled_X[:, mini_batch_size : <span class="number">2</span> * mini_batch_size]</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that the last mini-batch might end up smaller than<code>mini_batch_size=64</code>. Let $\lfloor s \rfloor$ represents $s$ rounded down to the nearest integer (this is <code>math.floor(s)</code> in Python). If the total number of examples is not a multiple of <code>mini_batch_size=64</code> then there will be $\lfloor \frac{m}{mini_batch_size}\rfloor$ mini-batches with a full 64 examples, and the number of examples in the final mini-batch will be $(m-mini__batch__size \times \lfloor \frac{m}{mini_batch_size}\rfloor)$.</p>

<h2 id="3-Momentum"><a href="#3-Momentum" class="headerlink" title="3. Momentum"></a>3. Momentum</h2><p>Because mini-batch gradient descent makes a parameter update after seeing just a subset of examples, the direction of the update has some variance, and so the path taken by mini-batch gradient descent will “oscillate” toward convergence. Using momentum can reduce these oscillations.</p>
<p>Momentum takes into account the past gradients to smooth out the update. We will store the ‘direction’ of the previous gradients in the variable $v$. Formally, this will be the exponentially weighted average of the gradient on previous steps. You can also think of $v$ as the “velocity” of a ball rolling downhill, building up speed (and momentum) according to the direction of the gradient/slope of the hill.</p>

            : The red arrows shows the direction taken by one step of mini-batch gradient descent with momentum. The blue points show the direction of the gradient (with respect to the current mini-batch) on each step. Rather than just following the gradient, we let the gradient influence $v$ and then take a step in the direction of $v$.

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Now, implement the parameters update with momentum. The momentum update rule is, <code>for l=1,...,L</code>:<br>$$<br>\begin{cases}<br>v_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta v_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta) dW^{[l]} \<br>W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \alpha v_{dW^{[l]}}<br>\end{cases}\tag{3}<br>$$<br>$$<br>\begin{cases}<br>v_{db^{[l]}} = \beta v_{db^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta) db^{[l]} \<br>b^{[l]} = b^{[l]} - \alpha v_{db^{[l]}}<br>\end{cases}\tag{4}<br>$$</p>
<p>where $L$ is the number of layers, $β$ is the momentum and $α$ is the learning rate. All parameters should be stored in the <code>parameters</code> dictionary. <strong>Note</strong> that the iterator $l$ starts at $0$ in the for loop while the first parameters are $W^{[1]}$ and $b^{[1]}$ (that’s a “one” on the superscript). So you will need to shift $l$ to $l + 1$ when coding.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> that: </p>
<ul>
<li>The velocity is initialized with zeros. So the algorithm will take a few iterations to “build up” velocity and start to take bigger steps. </li>
<li>If $β=0$, then this just becomes standard gradient descent without momentum.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do you choose $β$</strong>?</p>
<p>The larger the momentum $β$ is, the smoother the update because the more we take the past gradients into account. But if $β$ is too big, it could also smooth out the updates too much.<br>Common values for $β$ range from 0.8 to 0.999. If you don’t feel inclined to tune this, $β=0.9$ is often a reasonable default.<br>Tuning the optimal $β$ for your model might need trying several values to see what works best in term of reducing the value of the cost function $J$.</p>
<p><strong>What you should remember</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Momentum takes past gradients into account to smooth out the steps of gradient descent. It can be applied with batch gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. </li>
<li>You have to tune a momentum hyperparameter $β$ and a learning rate $α$.</li>

<p>*<em>How does Adam work? *</em></p>
<ol>
<li>It calculates an exponentially weighted average of past gradients, and stores it in variables $v$ (before bias correction) and $v^{corrected}$ (with bias correction). </li>

<li>It updates parameters in a direction based on combining information from “1” and “2”.</li>
</ol>
<p>The update rule is, <code>for l=1,...,L</code>:<br>$$\begin{cases}<br>v_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta_1 v_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta_1) \frac{\partial \mathcal{J} }{ \partial W^{[l]} } \<br>v^{corrected}<em>{dW^{[l]}} = \frac{v</em>{dW^{[l]}}}{1 - (\beta_1)^t} \<br>s_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta_2 s_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta_2) (\frac{\partial \mathcal{J} }{\partial W^{[l]} })^2 \<br>s^{corrected}<em>{dW^{[l]}} = \frac{s</em>{dW^{[l]}}}{1 - (\beta_2)^t} \<br>W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \alpha \frac{v^{corrected}<em>{dW^{[l]}}}{\sqrt{s^{corrected}</em>{dW^{[l]}}} + \varepsilon}<br>\end{cases}$$</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Now, implement the parameters update with Adam. Recall the general update rule is, <code>for l=1,...,L</code>:<br>$$\begin{cases}<br>v_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta_1 v_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta_1) \frac{\partial \mathcal{J} }{ \partial W^{[l]} } \<br>v^{corrected}<em>{dW^{[l]}} = \frac{v</em>{dW^{[l]}}}{1 - (\beta_1)^t} \<br>s_{dW^{[l]}} = \beta_2 s_{dW^{[l]}} + (1 - \beta_2) (\frac{\partial \mathcal{J} }{\partial W^{[l]} })^2 \<br>s^{corrected}<em>{dW^{[l]}} = \frac{s</em>{dW^{[l]}}}{1 - (\beta_2)^t} \<br>W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \alpha \frac{v^{corrected}<em>{dW^{[l]}}}{\sqrt{s^{corrected}</em>{dW^{[l]}}} + \varepsilon}<br>\end{cases}$$</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that the iterator <code>l</code> starts at <code>0</code> in the for loop while the first parameters are $W^{[1]}$ and $b^{[1]}$. You need to shift <code>l</code> to <code>l+1</code> when coding.</p>

<p>You now have three working optimization algorithms (mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, Adam). Let’s implement a model with each of these optimizers and observe the difference.</p>
<h2 id="5-Model-with-different-optimization-algorithms"><a href="#5-Model-with-different-optimization-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="5 - Model with different optimization algorithms"></a>5 - Model with different optimization algorithms</h2><p>Lets use the following “moons” dataset to test the different optimization methods.

<p>We have already implemented a 3-layer neural network. You will train it with: </p>
<ul>
<li>Mini-batch Gradient Descent: it will call your function: <code>update_parameters_with_gd()</code> </li>
<li>Mini-batch Momentum: it will call your functions: <code>initialize_velocity()</code> and <code>update_parameters_with_momentum()</code> </li>
<li>Mini-batch Adam: it will call your functions: <code>initialize_adam()</code> and <code>update_parameters_with_adam()</code></li>

<p>Momentum usually helps, but given the small learning rate and the simplistic dataset, its impact is almost negligeable. Also, the huge oscillations you see in the cost come from the fact that some minibatches are more difficult thans others for the optimization algorithm.</p>
<p>Adam on the other hand, clearly outperforms mini-batch gradient descent and Momentum. If you run the model for more epochs on this simple dataset, all three methods will lead to very good results. However, you’ve seen that Adam converges a lot faster.</p>
<p>Some advantages of Adam include:<br>- Relatively low memory requirements (though higher than gradient descent and gradient descent with momentum)<br>- Usually works well even with little tuning of hyperparameters (except $α$)</p>

Perhaps now you’ve learned how to implement a neural network. In this week you’ll learn the practical aspects of how to make your neural network work well. Ranging from things like <strong>hyperparameter tuning</strong> to how to set up your data, to how to make sure your optimization algorithm runs quickly so that you get your learning algorithm to learn in a reasonable time. In this first week we’ll first talk about the cellular machine learning problem, then we’ll talk about randomization. And we’ll talk about some tricks for making sure your neural network implementation is correct.</p>
<p>With that, let’s get started. Making good choices in how you set up your training, development, and test sets can make a huge difference in helping you quickly find a good high performance neural network.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When training a neural network you have to make a lot of decisions, such as how many layers will your neural network have? And how many hidden units do you want each layer to have? And what’s the learning rates? And what are the activation functions you want to use for the different layers? <strong>When you’re starting on a new application, it’s almost impossible to correctly guess the right values for all of these, and for other hyperparameter choices, on your first attempt</strong>. So in practice applied machine learning is <strong>a highly iterative process</strong>, in which you often start with an idea, such as you want to build a neural network of a certain number of layers, certain number of hidden units, maybe on certain data sets and so on. And then you just have to code it up and try it by running your code. You run and experiment and you get back a result that tells you how well this particular network, or this particular configuration works. And based on the outcome, you might then refine your ideas and change your choices and maybe keep iterating in order to try to find a better and a better neural network.</p>

You run and experiment and you get back a result that tells you how well this particular network, or this particular configuration works. And based on the outcome, you might then refine your ideas and change your choices and maybe keep iterating in order to try to find a better and a better neural network. Today, deep learning has found great success in a lot of areas. Ranging from natural language processing to computer vision to speech recognition to a lot of applications on also structured data. And structured data includes everything from advertisements to web search, which isn’t just Internet search engines it’s also, for example, shopping websites. Already any websites that wants deliver great search results when you enter terms into a search bar. To computer security, to logistics, such as figuring out where to send drivers to pick up and drop off things, to many more. So what I’m seeing is that sometimes a researcher with a lot of experience in NLP might try to do something in computer vision. Or maybe a researcher with a lot of experience in speech recognition might jump in and try to do something on advertising. Or someone from security might want to jump in and do something on logistics. <strong>And what I’ve seen is that intuitions from one domain or from one application area often do not transfer to other application areas</strong>. And the best choices may depend on the amount of data you have, the number of input features you have through your computer configuration and whether you’re training on GPUs or CPUs. And if so, exactly what configuration of GPUs and CPUs, and many other things. So for a lot of applications I think it’s almost impossible. <strong>Even very experienced deep learning people find it almost impossible to correctly guess the best choice of hyperparameters the very first time</strong>. And so today, applied deep learning is a very <strong>iterative process</strong> where you just have to go around this cycle many times to hopefully find a good choice of network for your application. <strong>So one of the things that determine how quickly you can make progress is how efficiently you can go around this cycle</strong>. And setting up your data sets well in terms of your train, development and test sets can make you much more efficient at that.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/2.png" alt=""><br>So if this is your training data, let’s draw that as a big box. Then traditionally you might take all the data you have and carve off some portion of it to be your <strong>training set</strong>. Some portion of it to be your <strong>hold-out cross validation set</strong>, and this is sometimes <strong>also called the development set</strong>. And <strong>for brevity I’m just going to call this the dev set</strong>, but all of these terms mean roughly the same thing. And then you might carve out some final portion of it to be your <strong>test set</strong>. And so the workflow is that you keep on training algorithms on your training sets. And use your dev set or your hold-out cross validation set to see which of many different models performs best on your dev set. And then after having done this long enough, when you have a final model that you want to evaluate, you can take the best model you have found and evaluate it on your test set. In order to get an unbiased estimate of how well your algorithm is doing. <strong>So in the previous era of machine learning, it was common practice to take all your data and split it according to maybe a 70/30% in terms of a people often talk about the 70/30 train test splits. If you don’t have an explicit dev set or maybe a 60/20/20% split in terms of 60% train, 20% dev and 20% test. And several years ago this was widely considered best practice in machine learning</strong>. If you have maybe 100 examples in total, maybe 1000 examples in total, maybe after 10,000 examples. <strong>These sorts of ratios were perfectly reasonable rules of thumb. But in the modern big data era</strong>, where, for example, you might have a million examples in total, <strong>then the trend is that your dev and test sets have been becoming a much smaller percentage of the total. Because remember, the goal of the dev set or the development set is that you’re going to test different algorithms on it and see which algorithm works better. So the dev set just needs to be big enough for you to evaluate, say, two different algorithm choices or ten different algorithm choices and quickly decide which one is doing better. And you might not need a whole 20% of your data for that</strong>. So, for example, if you have a million training examples you might decide that just having 10,000 examples in your dev set is more than enough to evaluate which one or two algorithms does better. <strong>And in a similar vein, the main goal of your test set is, given your final classifier, to give you a pretty confident estimate of how well it’s doing</strong>. And again, if you have a million examples maybe you might decide that 10,000 examples is more than enough in order to evaluate a single classifier and give you a good estimate of how well it’s doing. So in this example where you have a million examples, if you need just 10,000 for your dev and 10,000 for your test, your ratio will be more like his 10,000 is 1% of 1 million <strong>so you’ll have 98% train, 1% dev, 1% test. And I’ve also seen applications where, if you have even more than a million examples, you might end up with 99.5% train and 0.25% dev, 0.25% test. Or maybe a 0.4% dev, 0.1% test</strong>. So just to recap, when setting up your machine learning problem, I’ll often set it up into a train, dev and test sets, and if you have a relatively small dataset, these traditional ratios might be okay. But if you have a much larger data set, it’s also fine to set your dev and test sets to be much smaller than your 20% or even 10% of your data. <strong>We’ll give more specific guidelines on the sizes of dev and test sets later in this specialization</strong>.</p>
<p>One other trend we’re seeing in the era of modern deep learning is that more and more people train on mismatched train and test distributions.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s say you’re building an app that lets users upload a lot of pictures and your goal is to find pictures of cats in order to show your users. Maybe all your users are cat lovers. Maybe your training set comes from cat pictures downloaded off the Internet, but your dev and test sets might comprise cat pictures from users using our app. So maybe your training set has a lot of pictures crawled off the Internet but the dev and test sets are pictures uploaded by users. Turns out a lot of webpages have very high resolution, very professional, very nicely framed pictures of cats. But maybe your users are uploading blurrier, lower resolution images just taken with a cell phone camera in a more casual condition. And so these two distributions of data may be different. <strong>The rule of thumb I’d encourage you to follow in this case is to make sure that the dev and test sets come from the same distribution.</strong>  We’ll say more about this particular guideline as well, but <strong>because you will be using the dev set to evaluate a lot of different models and trying really hard to improve performance on the dev set. It’s nice if your dev set comes from the same distribution as your test set</strong>. But because deep learning algorithms have such a huge larger for training data, one trend I’m seeing is that you might use all sorts of creative tactics, such as crawling webpages, in order to acquire a much bigger training set than you would otherwise have. Even if part of the cost of that is then that your training set data might not come from the same distribution as your dev and test sets. <strong>But you find that so long as you follow this rule of thumb, that progress in your machine learning algorithm will be faster</strong>. And I’ll give a more detailed explanation for this particular rule of thumb later in the specialization as well. </p>
<p><strong>Finally, it might be okay to not have a test set</strong>. <em>Remember the goal of the test set is to give you a unbiased estimate of the performance of your final network, of the network that you selected</em>. But if you don’t need that unbiased estimate, then it might be okay to not have a test set. So what you do, if you have only a dev set but not a test set, is you train on the training set and then you try different model architectures. Evaluate them on the dev set, and then use that to iterate and try to get to a good model. Because you’ve fit your data to the dev set, this no longer gives you an unbiased estimate of performance. But if you don’t need one, that might be perfectly fine. <strong>In the machine learning world, when you have just a train and a dev set but no separate test set. Most people will call this a training set and they will call the dev set the test set. But what they actually end up doing is using the test set as a hold-out cross validation set. Which maybe isn’t completely a great use of terminology, because they’re then overfitting to the test set</strong>. So when the team tells you that they have only a train and a test set, I would just be cautious and think, do they really have a train dev set? Because they’re overfitting to the test set. Culturally, it might be difficult tochange some of these team’s terminology and get them to call it a trained devset rather than a trained test set. Even though I think calling it a train and development set would be more correct terminology. And this is actually okay practice if you don’t need a completely unbiased estimate of the performance of your algorithm. So having set up a train dev and test set will allow you to integrate more quickly. It will also allow you to more efficiently measure the bias and variance of your algorithm so you can more efficiently select ways to improve your algorithm. Let’s start to talk about that in the next video.</p>
<h3 id="02-bias-variance"><a href="#02-bias-variance" class="headerlink" title="02_bias-variance"></a>02_bias-variance</h3><p>I’ve noticed that almost all the really good machine learning practitioners tend to be very sophisticated in understanding of Bias and Variance. Bias and Variance is one of those concepts that’s easily learned but difficult to master. Even if you think you’ve seen the basic concepts of Bias and Variance, there’s often more new ones to it than you’d expect. In the Deep Learning Error, another trend is that there’s been less discussion of what’s called the bias-variance trade-off. You might have heard this thing called the bias-variance trade-off. But in Deep Learning Error there’s less of a trade-off, so we’d still still solve the bias, we still solve the variance, but we just talk less about the bias-variance trade-off. Let’s see what this means.</p>
<p>Let’s see the data set that looks like this. If you fit a straight line to the data, maybe get a logistic regression fit to that. This is not a very good fit to the data. And so this is class of a high bias, what we say that this is <strong>underfitting</strong> the data.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/4-1.png" alt=""><br>On the opposite end, if you fit an incredibly complex classifier, maybe deep neural network, or neural network with all the hidden units, maybe you can fit the data perfectly, but that doesn’t look like a great fit either. So there’s a classifier of high variance and this is <strong>overfitting</strong> the data.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/4-3.png" alt=""><br>And there might be some classifier in between, with a medium level of complexity, that maybe fits it correctly like that.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/4-2.png" alt=""><br>That looks like a much more reasonable fit to the data, so we call that <strong>just right</strong>. It’s somewhere in between. So in a 2D example like this, with just two features, X-1 and X-2, you can plot the data and visualize bias and variance. In high dimensional problems, you can’t plot the data and visualize division boundary.</p>
<p>Instead, there are couple of different metrics, that we’ll look at, to try to understand bias and variance. So continuing our example of cat picture classification, where that’s a positive example and that’s a negative example, the two key numbers to look at to understand bias and variance will be the train set error and the dev set or the development set error. So for the sake of argument, let’s say that you’re recognizing cats in pictures, is something that people can do nearly perfectly, right?</p>
<p>So let’s say, your training set error is 1% and your dev set error is, for the sake of argument, let’s say is 11%.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/5.png" alt=""><br>So in this example, you’re doing very well on the training set, but you’re doing relatively poorly on the development set. <strong>So this looks like you might have overfit the training set, that somehow you’re not generalizing well, to this whole cross-validation set in the development set</strong>. And so if you have an example like this, we would say this has <strong>high variance</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>So by looking at the training set error and the development set error, you would be able to render a diagnosis of your algorithm having high variance. Now, let’s say, that you measure your training set and your dev set error, and you get a different result.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say, that your training set error is 15%. I’m writing your training set error in the top row, and your dev set error is 16%.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/5.png" alt=""><br><strong>In this case, assuming that humans achieve roughly 0% error, that humans can look at these pictures and just tell if it’s cat or not</strong>, then it looks like the algorithm is not even doing very well on the training set. So if it’s not even fitting the training data set well, then this is <strong>underfitting</strong> the data. And so this algorithm has <strong>high bias</strong>. <strong>But in contrast, this actually generalizing at a reasonable level to the dev set, whereas performance in the dev set is only 1% worse than performance in the training set. So this algorithm has a problem of high bias, because it was not even fitting the training set</strong>. Well, this is similar to the leftmost plots we had on the previous slide. </p>
<p>Now, here’s another example. Let’s say that you have 15% training set error, so that’s pretty high bias, but when you evaluate to the dev set it does even worse, maybe it does 30%.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/5.png" alt=""><br>In this case, I would diagnose this algorithm as having high bias, because it’s not doing that well on the training set, and high variance. So this has really the worst of both worlds. And one last example, if you have 0.5 training set error, and 1% dev set error, then maybe our users are quite happy, that you have a cat classifier with only 1%, than just we have <strong>low bias and low variance</strong>. </p>
<p>One subtlety, that I’ll just briefly mention that we’ll leave to a later video to discuss in detail, is that this analysis is predicated on the assumption, that human level performance gets nearly 0% error or, more generally, that the <strong>optimal error</strong>, sometimes called <strong>base error</strong>, so the base in optimal error is nearly 0%. I don’t want to go into detail on this in this particular video, but it turns out that if the optimal error or the base error were much higher, say, it were 15%, then if you look at this classifier, 15% is actually perfectly reasonable for training set and you wouldn’t see it as high bias and also a pretty low variance. So the case of how to analyze bias and variance, when no classifier can do very well, for example, if you have really blurry images, so that even a human or just no system could possibly do very well, then maybe base error is much higher, and then there are some details of how this analysis will change. <strong>But leaving aside this subtlety for now, the takeaway is that by looking at your training set error you can get a sense of how well you are fitting, at least the training data, and so that tells you if you have a bias problem. And then looking at how much higher your error goes, when you go from the training set to the dev set, that should give you a sense of how bad is the variance problem, so you’ll be doing a good job generalizing from a training set to the dev set, that gives you sense of your variance. All this is under the assumption that the base error is quite small and that your training and your dev sets are drawn from the same distribution. If those assumptions are violated, there’s a more sophisticated analysis you could do</strong>, which we’ll talk about in the later video.</p>
<p>Now, on the previous slide, you saw what high bias, high variance looks like? and I guess you have the sense of what it a good class can look like. What does high bias and high variance looks like? This is kind of the worst of both worlds. So you remember, we said that a classifier like this, then your classifier has high bias, because it underfits the data.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/4-1.png" alt=""><br>So this would be a classifier that is mostly linear and therefore underfits the data, we’re drawing this is purple. But if somehow your classifier does some weird things, then it is actually overfitting parts of the data as well.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/6.png" alt=""><br>So <strong>this would be a classifier that is <em>mostly</em> linear and therefore underfits the data</strong>, we’re drawing this is <strong>purple</strong>. But if somehow your classifier does some weird things, <strong>then it is actually overfitting <em>parts</em> of the data as well</strong>. So the classifier that I drew in purple, has both high bias and high variance. Where it has high bias, because, by being a mostly linear classifier, is just not fitting. You know, this quadratic line shape that well, but by having too much flexibility in the middle, it somehow gets this example, and this example overfits those two examples as well. So this classifier kind of has high bias because it was mostly linear, but you need maybe a curve function or quadratic function. And it has high variance, because it had too much flexibility to fit those two mislabel, or those live examples in the middle as well. <strong>In case this seems contrived, well, this example is a little bit contrived in two dimensions, but with very high dimensional inputs. You actually do get things with high bias in some regions and high variance in some regions, and so it is possible to get classifiers like this in high dimensional inputs that seem less contrived</strong>. </p>
<p>So to summarize, you’ve seen how by looking at your algorithm’s error on the training set and your algorithm’s error on the dev set you can try to diagnose, whether it has problems of high bias or high variance, or maybe both, or maybe neither. And depending on whether your algorithm suffers from bias or variance, it turns out that there are different things you could try. <strong>So in the next video, I want to present to you, what I call a basic recipe for Machine Learning, that lets you more systematically try to improve your algorithm, depending on whether it has high bias or high variance issues</strong>. So let’s go on to the next video.</p>
<h3 id="03-basic-recipe-for-machine-learning"><a href="#03-basic-recipe-for-machine-learning" class="headerlink" title="03_basic-recipe-for-machine-learning"></a>03_basic-recipe-for-machine-learning</h3><p>In the previous video, you saw how looking at training error and depth error can help you diagnose whether your algorithm has a bias or a variance problem, or maybe both. It turns out that this information that lets you much more systematically using what they call a basic recipe for machine learning and lets you much more systematically go about improving your algorithms’ performance. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/7.png" alt=""><br>When training a neural network, here’s a basic recipe I will use. After having trained an initial model, I will <strong>first ask, does your algorithm have high bias?</strong> And so to try and evaluate if there is high bias, you should look at, really, the training set or the training data performance. Right. And so, <em>if it does have high bias, does not even fit in the training set that well, some things you could try would be to try pick a network, <strong>such as more hidden layers or more hidden units</strong>, or you could train it longer. <strong>Maybe run trains longer or try some more advanced optimization algorithms</strong>, which we’ll talk about later in this course. Or you can also try, this is kind of a, maybe it work, maybe it won’t. But we’ll see later that there are a lot of different neural network architectures and <strong>maybe you can find a new network architecture that’s better suited for this problem</strong>. Putting this in parentheses because one of those things that, you just have to try. Maybe you can make it work, maybe not. Whereas getting a bigger network almost always helps. And training longer doesn’t always help, but it certainly never hurts. So when training a learning algorithm, I would try these things until I can at least get rid of the bias problems</em>, as in go back after I’ve tried this and keep doing that until I can fit, at least, fit the training set pretty well. </p>
<p>And usually if you have a big enough network, you should usually be able to fit the training data well so long as it’s a problem that is possible for someone to do, alright? If the image is very blurry, it may be impossible to fit it. But if at least a human can do well on the task, if you think base error is not too high, then by training a big enough network you should be able to, hopefully, do well, at least on the training set. To at least fit or overfit the training set. <strong>Once you reduce bias to acceptable amounts then ask, do you have a variance problem?</strong> And so to evaluate that I would look at dev set performance. Are you able to generalize from a pretty good training set performance to having a pretty good dev set performance? And if you have high variance, well, <strong>best way to solve a high variance problem is to get more data</strong>. If you can get it this, you know, can only help. <strong>But sometimes you can’t get more data. Or you could try regularization</strong>, which we’ll talk about in the next video, to try to reduce overfitting. <strong>And then also, again, sometimes you just have to try it. But if you can find a more appropriate neural network architecture, sometimes that can reduce your variance problem as well, as well as reduce your bias problem</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>But how to do that? It’s harder to be totally systematic how you do that. But so I try these things and I kind of keep going back, until hopefully you find something with both low bias and low variance, whereupon you would be done. So a couple of points to notice</strong>. <strong>First</strong> is that, depending on whether you have high bias or high variance, the set of things you should try could be quite different. So I’ll usually use the training dev set to try to diagnose if you have a bias or variance problem, and then use that to select the appropriate subset of things to try. So for example, if you actually have a high bias problem, getting more training data is actually not going to help. Or at least it’s not the most efficient thing to do. <strong>So being clear on how much of a bias problem or variance problem or both can help you focus on selecting the most useful things to try</strong>. <strong>Second</strong>, in the earlier era of machine learning, there used to be a lot of discussion on what is called <strong>the bias variance tradeoff</strong>. And the reason for that was that, for a lot of the things you could try, you could increase bias and reduce variance, or reduce bias and increase variance. <em>But back in the pre-deep learning era, we didn’t have many tools, we didn’t have as many tools that just reduce bias or that just reduce variance without hurting the other one. But in the modern deep learning, big data era, so long as you can keep training a bigger network, and so long as you can keep getting more data, which isn’t always the case for either of these, but if that’s the case, then getting a bigger network almost always just reduces your bias without necessarily hurting your variance, so long as you regularize appropriately. And getting more data pretty much always reduces your variance and doesn’t hurt your bias much</em>. <strong>So what’s really happened is that, with these two steps, the ability to train, pick a network, or get more data, we now have tools to drive down bias and just drive down bias, or drive down variance and just drive down variance, without really hurting the other thing that much</strong>. <em>And I think this has been one of the big reasons that deep learning has been so useful for supervised learning, that there’s much less of this tradeoff where you have to carefully balance bias and variance, but sometimes you just have more options for reducing bias or reducing variance without necessarily increasing the other one.</em> </p>
<p>And, in fact, [inaudible] you have a well regularized network. We’ll talk about regularization starting from the next video. <strong>Training a bigger network almost never hurts. And the main cost of training a neural network that’s too big is just computational time, so long as you’re regularizing</strong>. </p>
<p>So I hope this gives you a sense of the basic structure of how to organize your machine learning problem to diagnose bias and variance, and then try to select the right operation for you to make progress on your problem. <strong>One of the things I mentioned several times in the video is regularization, is a very useful technique for reducing variance. There is a little bit of a bias variance tradeoff when you use regularization. It might increase the bias a little bit, although often not too much if you have a huge enough network. But let’s dive into more details in the next video so you can better understand how to apply regularization to your neural network.</strong></p>
<h2 id="02-regularizing-your-neural-network"><a href="#02-regularizing-your-neural-network" class="headerlink" title="02_regularizing-your-neural-network"></a>02_regularizing-your-neural-network</h2><h3 id="01-regularization"><a href="#01-regularization" class="headerlink" title="01_regularization"></a>01_regularization</h3><p>If you suspect your neural network is over fitting your data. That is you have a high variance problem, one of the first things you should try per probably regularization. The other way to address high variance, is to get more training data that’s also quite reliable. But you can’t always get more training data, or it could be expensive to get more data. But adding regularization will often help to prevent overfitting, or to reduce the errors in your network. So let’s see how regularization works.</p>
<h4 id="regularization-for-logistic-regression"><a href="#regularization-for-logistic-regression" class="headerlink" title="regularization for logistic regression"></a>regularization for logistic regression</h4><p>Let’s develop these ideas using logistic regression. Recall that for logistic regression, you try to minimize the cost function J, which is defined as this cost function. Some of your training examples of the losses of the individual predictions in the different examples, where you recall that w and b in the logistic regression, are the parameters. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/8.png" alt=""><br>So w is an x-dimensional parameter vector, and b is a real number. And so to add regularization to the logistic regression, what you do is add to it this thing, lambda, which is called the <strong>regularization parameter</strong>. I’ll say more about that in a second. But lambda/2m times the norm of w squared. So here, the norm of w squared is just equal to sum from j equals 1 to nx of wj squared, or this can also be written w transpose w, it’s just a square Euclidean norm of the prime to vector w. And this is called <strong>L2 regularization</strong>. <strong>Because here, you’re using the Euclidean normals, or else the L2 norm with the prime to vector w</strong>. Now, why do you regularize just the parameter w? Why don’t we add something here about b as well? In practice, you could do this, but I usually just omit this. Because if you look at your parameters, w is usually a pretty high dimensional parameter vector, especially with a high variance problem. Maybe w just has a lot of parameters, so you aren’t fitting all the parameters well, whereas b is just a single number. So almost all the parameters are in w rather b. And if you add this last term in practice, it won’t make much of a difference, because b is just one parameter over a very large number of parameters. In practice, I usually just don’t bother to include it. But you can if you want. So L2 regularization is the most common type of regularization. You might have also heard of some people talk about <strong>L1 regularization</strong>. <strong>And that’s when you add, instead of this L2 norm, you instead add a term that is lambda/m of sum over of this. And this is also called the L1 norm of the parameter vector w</strong>, so the little subscript 1 down there, right? And I guess whether you put m or 2m in the denominator, is just a scaling constant. If you use L1 regularization, then w will end up being <strong>sparse</strong>. And what that means is that the w vector will have a lot of zeros in it. <strong>And some people say that this can help with compressing the model, because the set of parameters are zero, and you need less memory to store the model. Although, I find that, in practice, L1 regularization to make your model sparse, helps only a little bit. So I don’t think it’s used that much, at least not for the purpose of compressing your model. And when people train your networks, L2 regularization is just used much much more often</strong>. Sorry, just fixing up some of the notation here. So <strong>one last detail. Lambda here is called the regularization, Parameter. And usually, you set this using your development set, or using [INAUDIBLE] cross validation. When you a variety of values and see what does the best, in terms of trading off between doing well in your training set versus also setting that two normal of your parameters to be small. Which helps prevent over fitting. So lambda is another hyper parameter that you might have to tune</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>And by the way, for the programming exercises, lambda is a reserved keyword in the Python programming language. So in the programming exercise, we’ll have lambd, without the a, so as not to clash with the reserved keyword in Python. So we use lambd to represent the lambda regularization parameter</strong>. So this is how you implement L2 regularization for logistic regression.</p>
<h4 id="regularization-for-neural-network"><a href="#regularization-for-neural-network" class="headerlink" title="regularization for neural network"></a>regularization for neural network</h4><p>How about a neural network? In a neural network, you have a cost function that’s a function of all of your parameters, w[1], b[1] through w[L], b[L], <strong>where capital L is the number of layers in your neural network</strong>. And so the cost function is this, sum of the losses, summed over your m training examples. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/9.png" alt=""><br>And says at regularization, you add lambda over 2m of sum over all of your parameters W, your parameter matrix is w, of their, that’s called the squared norm. Where this norm of a matrix, meaning the squared norm is defined as the sum of the i sum of j, of each of the elements of that matrix, squared. And if you want the indices of this summation. This is sum from i=1 through n[l-1]. Sum from j=1 through n[l], because w is an n[l-1] by n[l] dimensional matrix, where these are the number of units in layers [l-1] in layer l. So this matrix norm, it turns out is called the Frobenius norm of the matrix, denoted with a F in the subscript. So for arcane linear algebra technical reasons, this is not called <strong>the l2 normal of a matrix</strong>. Instead, it’s called the <strong>Frobenius norm of a matrix</strong>. I know it sounds like it would be more natural to just call the l2 norm of the matrix, but for really arcane reasons that you don’t need to know, by convention, this is called the Frobenius norm. It just means the sum of square of elements of a matrix. So how do you implement gradient descent with this? Previously, we would complete dw using backprop, where backprop would give us the partial derivative of J with respect to w, or really w for any given [l]. And then you update w[l], as w[l]- the learning rate times d. So this is before we added this extra regularization term to the objective. Now that we’ve added this regularization term to the objective, what you do is you take dw and you add to it, lambda/m times w. And then you just compute this update, same as before. And it turns out that with this new definition of dw[l], this new dw[l] is still a correct definition of the derivative of your cost function, with respect to your parameters, now that you’ve added the extra regularization term at the end. And it’s for this reason that L2 regularization is sometimes also called weight decay. So if I take this definition of dw[l] and just plug it in here, then you see that the update is w[l] = w[l] times the learning rate alpha times the thing from backprop, +lambda of m times w[l]. Throw the minus sign there. And so this is equal to w[l]- alpha lambda / m times w[l]- alpha times the thing you got from backpop. And so this term shows that whatever the matrix w[l] is, you’re going to make it a little bit smaller, right? <strong>This is actually as if you’re taking the matrix w and you’re multiplying it by 1-alpha lambda/m. You’re really taking the matrix w and subtracting alpha lambda/m times this. Like you’re multiplying matrix w by this number, which is going to be a little bit less than 1. So this is why L2 norm regularization is also called weight decay</strong>. Because it’s just like the ordinally gradient descent, where you update w by subtracting alpha times the original gradient you got from backprop. But now you’re also multiplying w by this thing, which is a little bit less than 1. So the alternative name for L2 regularization is weight decay. I’m not really going to use that name, but the intuition for it’s called weight decay is that this first term here, is equal to this. So you’re just multiplying the weight metrics by a number slightly less than 1. So that’s how you implement L2 regularization in neural network. Now, one question that [INAUDIBLE] has asked me is, hey, Andrew, why does regularization prevent over-fitting? Let’s look at the next video, and gain some intuition for how regularization prevents over-fitting.</p>
<h3 id="02-why-regularization-reduces-overfitting"><a href="#02-why-regularization-reduces-overfitting" class="headerlink" title="02_why-regularization-reduces-overfitting"></a>02_why-regularization-reduces-overfitting</h3><p>Why does regularization help with overfitting? Why does it help with reducing variance problems? Let’s go through a couple examples to gain some intuition about how it works. So, recall that high bias, high variance. And I just write pictures from our earlier video that looks something like this. Now, let’s see a fitting large and deep neural network. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I know I haven’t drawn this one too large or too deep, unless you think some neural network and this currently overfitting. So you have some cost function like J of W, B equals sum of the losses. So what we did for regularization was add this extra term that penalizes the weight matrices from being too large. So that was the Frobenius norm. So why is it that shrinking the L two norm or the Frobenius norm or the parameters might cause less overfitting?</p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/11.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>One piece of intuition is that if you crank regularisation lambda to be really, really big, they’ll be really incentivized to set the weight matrices W to be reasonably close to zero. So one piece of intuition is maybe it set the weight to be so close to zero for a lot of hidden units that’s basically zeroing out a lot of the impact of these hidden units. And if that’s the case, then this much simplified neural network becomes a much smaller neural network. In fact, it is almost like a logistic regression unit, but stacked most probably as deep. And so that will take you from this overfitting case much closer to the left to other high bias case</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>But hopefully there’ll be an intermediate value of lambda that results in a result closer to this just right case in the middle</strong>. But the intuition is that by cranking up lambda to be really big they’ll set W close to zero, which in practice this isn’t actually what happens. We can think of it as zeroing out or at least reducing the impact of a lot of the hidden units so you end up with what might feel like a simpler network. They get closer and closer as if you’re just using logistic regression. <strong>The intuition of completely zeroing out of a bunch of hidden units isn’t quite right. It turns out that what actually happens is they’ll still use all the hidden units, but each of them would just have a much smaller effect. But you do end up with a simpler network and as if you have a smaller network that is therefore less prone to overfitting</strong>. So a lot of this intuition helps better when you implement regularization in the program exercise, you actually see some of these variance reduction results yourself. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here’s another attempt at additional intuition for why regularization helps prevent overfitting. And for this, I’m going to assume that we’re using the tanh activation function which looks like this. This is a g of z equals tanh of z. So if that’s the case, notice that so long as Z is quite small, so if Z takes on only a smallish range of parameters, maybe around here, then you’re just using the linear regime of the tanh function. Is only if Z is allowed to wander up to larger values or smaller values like so, that the activation function starts to become less linear. So the intuition you might take away from this is that if lambda, the regularization parameter, is large, then you have that your parameters will be relatively small, because they are penalized being large into a cos function. And so if the blades W are small then because Z is equal to W and then technically is plus b, but if W tends to be very small, then Z will also be relatively small. And in particular, if Z ends up taking relatively small values, just in this whole range, then G of Z will be roughly linear. So it’s as if every layer will be roughly linear. As if it is just linear regression. And we saw in course one that if every layer is linear then your whole network is just a linear network. And so even a very deep network, with a deep network with a linear activation function is at the end they are only able to compute a linear function. So it’s not able to fit those very very complicated decision. Very non-linear decision boundaries that allow it to really overfit right to data sets like we saw on the overfitting high variance case on the previous slide. <strong>So just to summarize, if the regularization becomes very large, the parameters W very small, so Z will be relatively small, kind of ignoring the effects of b for now, so Z will be relatively small or, really, I should say it takes on a small range of values. And so the activation function if is tanh, say, will be relatively linear. And so your whole neural network will be computing something not too far from a big linear function which is therefore pretty simple function rather than a very complex highly non-linear function. And so is also much less able to overfit</strong>. </p>
<p>And again, when you enter in regularization for yourself in the program exercise, you’ll be able to see some of these effects yourself. Before wrapping up our discussion on regularization, I just want to give you one implementational tip. Which is that, when implanting regularization, we took our definition of the cost function J and we actually modified it by adding this extra term that penalizes the weight being too large. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/13.png" alt=""><br>And so if you implement gradient descent, one of the steps to debug gradient descent is to plot the cost function J as a function of the number of elevations of gradient descent and you want to see that the cost function J decreases monotonically after every elevation of gradient descent. And if you’re implementing regularization then please remember that J now has this new definition. If you plot the old definition of J, just this first term, then you might not see a decrease monotonically. So to debug gradient descent make sure that you’re plotting this new definition of J that includes this second term as well. Otherwise you might not see J decrease monotonically on every single elevation. So that’s it for L two regularization which is actually a regularization technique that I use the most in training deep learning modules. In deep learning there is another sometimes used regularization technique called dropout regularization. Let’s take a look at that in the next video.</p>
<h3 id="03-dropout-regularization"><a href="#03-dropout-regularization" class="headerlink" title="03_dropout-regularization"></a>03_dropout-regularization</h3><p>In addition to L2 regularization, another very powerful  regularization techniques is called “dropout.”</p>
<p>Let’s see how that works. Let’s say you train a neural network like the one on the left and there’s over-fitting. Here’s what you do with dropout. Let me make a copy of the neural network.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/15.png" alt=""><br>With dropout, what we’re going to do is go through each of the layers of the network and set some probability of eliminating a node in neural network. Let’s say that for each of these layers, we’re going to- for each node, toss a coin and have a 0.5 chance of keeping each node and 0.5 chance of removing each node.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/14.png" alt=""><br>So, after the coin tosses, maybe we’ll decide to eliminate those nodes, then what you do is actually remove all the outgoing things from that no as well. So you end up with a much smaller, really much diminished network.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/16.png" alt=""><br>And then you do back propagation training. There’s one example on this much diminished network. <strong>And then on different examples, you would toss a set of coins again and keep a different set of nodes and then dropout or eliminate different than nodes. And so for each training example, you would train it using one of these neural based networks.</strong></p>
<p>So, <strong>maybe it seems like a slightly crazy technique. They just go around coding those are random, but this actually works. But you can imagine that because you’re training a much smaller network on each example or maybe just give a sense for why you end up able to regularize the network, because these much smaller networks are being trained</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Inverted-dropout"><a href="#Inverted-dropout" class="headerlink" title="Inverted dropout"></a>Inverted dropout</h4><p>Let’s look at how you implement dropout. There are a few ways of implementing dropout. I’m going to show you the most common one, which is technique called <strong>inverted dropout</strong>.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, let’s say we want to illustrate this with layer l=3. So, in the code I’m going to write- there will be a bunch of 3s here. <strong>I’m just illustrating how to represent dropout in a single layer</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/17.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, what we are going to do is set a vector d and d^3 is going to be the dropout vector for the layer 3. That’s what the d3 is to be np.random.rand(a). And this is going to be the same shape as a3. And when I see if this is less than some number, which I’m going to call <strong>keep.prob</strong>. And so, keep.prob is a number. It was 0.5 on the previous time, and maybe now I’ll use 0.8 in this example, and there will be the probability that a given hidden unit will be kept. <strong>So to set keep.prob = 0.8, then this means that there’s a 0.2 chance of eliminating any hidden unit</strong>. So, what it does is it generates a random matrix. And this works as well if you have factorized. So d3 will be a matrix. Therefore, each example have a each hidden unit there’s a 0.8 chance that the corresponding d3 will be one, and a 20% chance there will be zero. So, this random numbers being less than 0.8 it has a 0.8 chance of being one or be true, and 20% or 0.2 chance of being false, of being zero. </p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">keep_prob = <span class="number">0.8</span>  <span class="comment"># 设置神经元保留概率</span></span><br><span class="line">d3 = np.random.rand(a3.shape[<span class="number">0</span>], a3.shape[<span class="number">1</span>]) &lt; keep_prob</span><br><span class="line">a3 = np.multiply(a3, d3) <span class="comment"># equal to a3 *= d3;</span></span><br><span class="line">a3 /= keep_prob</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p><strong>There was a 20% chance of each of the elements of d3 being zero, just multiply operation ends up zeroing out, the corresponding element of d3. If you do this in python, technically d3 will be a boolean array where value is true and false, rather than one and zero. But the multiply operation works and will interpret the true and false values as one and zero</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Then finally, we’re going to take a3 and scale it up by dividing by 0.8 or really dividing by our keep.prob parameter</strong>. </p>
<p>So, let me explain what this final step is doing. Let’s say for the sake of argument that you have 50 units or 50 neurons in the third hidden layer. So maybe a3 is 50 by one dimensional or if you- factorization maybe it’s 50 by m dimensional. So, if you have a 80% chance of keeping them and 20% chance of eliminating them. This means that on average, you end up with 10 units shut off or 10 units zeroed out. And so now, if you look at the value of z^4, $Z^{[4]}=W^{[4]}\cdot a^{[3]}+b^{[4]}$ . And so, on expectation, this will be reduced by 20%. <strong>By which I mean that 20% of the elements of a3 will be zeroed out. So, in order to not reduce the expected value of z^4, what you do is you need to take this, and divide it by 0.8 because this will correct or just a bump that back up by roughly 20% that you need</strong>. So it’s not changed the expected value of a3. And, so this line here is what’s called the <strong>inverted dropout technique</strong>. And its effect is that, no matter what you set to keep.prob to, whether it’s 0.8 or 0.9 or even one, if it’s set to one then there’s no dropout, because it’s keeping everything or 0.5 or whatever, <strong>this inverted dropout technique by dividing by the keep.prob, it ensures that the expected value of a3 remains the same</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/17.png" alt=""><br>And <strong>it turns out that at test time, when you trying to evaluate a neural network, which we’ll talk about on the next slide, this inverted dropout technique, there is line to are due to the green box at dropping out. This makes test time easier because you have less of a scaling problem</strong>. </p>
<p>By far the most common implementation of dropouts today as far as I know is inverted dropouts. I recommend you just implement this. But there were some early iterations of dropout that missed this divide by keep.prob line, and so at test time the average becomes more and more complicated. But again, people tend not to use those other versions. <strong>So, what you do is you use the d vector, and you’ll notice that for different training examples, you zero out different hidden units</strong>. And in fact, if you make multiple passes through the same training set, then on different pauses through the training set, you should randomly zero out different hidden units. <strong>So, it’s not that for one example, you should keep zeroing out the same hidden units is that, on iteration one of gradient descent, you might zero out some hidden units. And on the second iteration of gradient descent where you go through the training set the second time, maybe you’ll zero out a different pattern of hidden units.</strong> </p>
<p>And the vector d or d3, for the third layer, is used to decide what to zero out, both in foreprob as well as in that backprob. We are just showing for prob here.</p>
<h4 id="Don’t-use-dropout-at-test-time"><a href="#Don’t-use-dropout-at-test-time" class="headerlink" title="Don’t use dropout at test time"></a>Don’t use dropout at test time</h4><p>At test time, you’re given some x or which you want to make a prediction. And using our standard notation, I’m going to use a^0, the activations of the zeroes layer to denote just test example x. <strong>So what we’re going to do is not to use dropout at test time</strong> in particular which is in a sense. Z^1= w^1.a^0 + b^1. a^1 = g^1(z^1 Z). Z^2 = w^2.a^1 + b^2. a^2 =… And so on. Until you get to the last layer and that you make a prediction y^. But notice that the test time you’re not using dropout explicitly and you’re not tossing coins at random, you’re not flipping coins to decide which hidden units to eliminate. <strong>And that’s because when you are making predictions at the test time, you don’t really want your output to be random. If you are implementing dropout at test time, that just add noise to your predictions. In theory, one thing you could do is run a prediction process many times with different hidden units randomly dropped out and have it across them. But that’s computationally inefficient and will give you roughly the same result; very, very similar results to this different procedure as well. And just to mention, the inverted dropout thing, you remember the step on the previous line when we divided by the keep_prob. The effect of that was to ensure that even when you don’t see men dropout at test time to the scaling, the expected value of these activations don’t change. So, you don’t need to add in an extra funny scaling parameter at test time. That’s different than when you have that training time</strong>. </p>
<p>So that’s dropouts. And when you implement this in week’s premier exercise, you gain more firsthand experience with it as well. But why does it really work? What I want to do the next video is give you some better intuition about what dropout really is doing. Let’s go on to the next video.</p>
<h3 id="04-understanding-dropout"><a href="#04-understanding-dropout" class="headerlink" title="04_understanding-dropout"></a>04_understanding-dropout</h3><p>Drop out does this seemingly crazy thing of randomly knocking out units on your network. Why does it work so well with a regularizer? Let’s gain some better intuition. In the previous video, I gave this intuition that drop-out randomly knocks out units in your network. <strong>So it’s as if on every iteration you’re working with a smaller neural network, and so using a smaller neural network seems like it should have a regularizing effect</strong>. </p>
<h4 id="spread-out-weights"><a href="#spread-out-weights" class="headerlink" title="spread out weights"></a>spread out weights</h4><p>Here’s a second intuition which is, let’s look at it from the perspective of a single unit. Let’s say this one. Now, for this unit to do his job as for inputs and it needs to generate some meaningful output. <strong>Now with drop out, the inputs can get randomly eliminated</strong>.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/19.png" alt=""><br>Sometimes those two units will get eliminated, sometimes a different unit will get eliminated. <strong>So, what this means is that this unit, which I’m circling in purple, it can’t rely on any one feature because any one feature could go away at random or any one of its own inputs could go away at random</strong>. Some particular would be reluctant to put all of its bets on, say, just this input, right? <strong>The weights, we’re reluctant to put too much weight on any one input because it can go away. So this unit will be more motivated to spread out this way and give you a little bit of weight to each of the four inputs to this unit. And by spreading all the weights, this will tend to have an effect of shrinking the squared norm of the weights. And so, similar to what we saw with L2 regularization, the effect of implementing drop out is that it shrinks the weights and does some of those outer regularization that helps prevent over-fitting</strong>. But it turns out that drop out can formally be shown to be an adaptive form without a regularization. But L2 penalty on different weights are different, depending on the size of the activations being multiplied that way. </p>
<p>But to summarize, it is possible to show that drop out has a similar effect to L2 regularization. Only to L2 regularization applied to different ways can be a little bit different and even more adaptive to the scale of different inputs. </p>
<h4 id="One-more-detail-for-when-you’re-implementing-drop-out"><a href="#One-more-detail-for-when-you’re-implementing-drop-out" class="headerlink" title="One more detail for when you’re implementing drop out"></a>One more detail for when you’re implementing drop out</h4><p>Here’s a network where you have three input features.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/20.png" alt=""><br>This is seven hidden units here, seven, three, two, one. <strong>So, one of the parameters we had to choose was the keep_prop which has a chance of keeping a unit in each layer</strong>. So, it is also feasible to vary keep_prop by layer. So for the first layer, your matrix W1 will be three by seven. Your second weight matrix will be seven by seven. W3 will be seven by three and so on. <strong>And so W2 is actually the biggest weight matrix, because they’re actually the largest set of parameters would be in W2 which is seven by seven. So to prevent, to reduce over-fitting of that matrix, maybe for this layer, I guess this is layer two, you might have a keep_prop that’s relatively low, say $0.5$, whereas for different layers where you might worry less about over-fitting, you could have a higher keep_prop, maybe just $0.7$ . And if a layers we don’t worry about over-fitting at all, you can have a key prop of one point zero.</strong><br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/21.png" alt=""><br>For clarity, <strong>these are numbers I’m drawing on the purple boxes</strong>. These could be different keep_props for different layers. <strong>Notice that the keep_prop of one point zero means that you’re keeping every unit and so, you’re really not using drop out for that layer. But for layers where you’re more worried about over-fitting, really the layers with a lot of parameters, you can set the key prop to be smaller to apply a more powerful form of drop out. It’s kind of like cranking up the regularization parameter lambda of L2 regularization where you try to regularize some layers more than others. And technically, you can also apply drop out to the input layer, where you can have some chance of just maxing out one or more of the input features. Although in practice, usually don’t do that that often. And so, a key prop of one point zero was quite common for the input there. You can also use a very high value, maybe zero point nine, but it’s much less likely that you want to eliminate half of the input features.</strong> So usually keep_prop, if you apply the law, will be a number close to one if you even apply drop out at all to the input there. </p>
<p>So just to summarize, if you’re more worried about some layers overfitting than others, you can set a lower key prop for some layers than others. The downside is, this gives you even more hyper parameters to search for using cross-validation. One other alternative might be to have some layers where you apply drop out and some layers where you don’t apply drop out and then just have one hyper parameter, which is a keep_prop for the layers for which you do apply drop outs. </p>
<p>And before we wrap up, just a couple implementational tips. Many of the first successful implementations of drop outs were to computer vision. <strong>So in computer vision, the input size is so big, inputting all these pixels that you almost never have enough data. And so drop out is very frequently used by computer vision. And there’s some computer vision researchers that pretty much always use it, almost as a default.</strong> But really the thing to remember is that drop out is a regularization technique, it helps prevent over-fitting. And so, unless my algorithm is over-fitting, I wouldn’t actually bother to use drop out. So it’s used somewhat less often than other application areas. There’s just with computer vision, you usually just don’t have enough data, so you’re almost always overfitting, which is why there tends to be some computer vision researchers who swear by drop out. But their intuition doesn’t always generalize I think to other disciplines. </p>
<p><strong>One big downside of drop out is that the cost function J is no longer well-defined</strong>. On every iteration, you are randomly killing off a bunch of nodes. And so, if you are double checking the performance of gradient descent, it’s actually harder to double check that you have a well defined cost function J that is going downhill on every iteration. Because the cost function J that you’re optimizing is actually less. Less well defined, or is certainly hard to calculate. So you lose this debugging tool to will a plot, a graph like this.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/21.png" alt=""><br><strong>So what I usually do is turn off drop out, you will set keep_prop equals one, and I run my code and make sure that it is monotonically decreasing J, and then turn on drop out and hope that I didn’t introduce bugs into my code during drop out</strong>. Because you need other ways, I guess, but not plotting these figures to make sure that your code is working to greatness and it’s working even with drop outs. So with that, there’s still a few more regularization techniques that are worth your knowing. Let’s talk about a few more such techniques in the next video.</p>
<h3 id="05-other-regularization-methods"><a href="#05-other-regularization-methods" class="headerlink" title="05_other-regularization-methods"></a>05_other-regularization-methods</h3><p>In addition to L2 regularization and drop out regularization there are few other techniques to reducing over fitting in your neural network. </p>
<h4 id="cat-recognition"><a href="#cat-recognition" class="headerlink" title="cat recognition"></a>cat recognition</h4><p>Let’s take a look. Let’s say you fitting a cat classifier. <strong>If you are overfitting getting more training data can help, but getting more training data can be expensive and sometimes you just can’t get more data</strong>. But what you can do is augment your training set by taking image like this.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/22.png" alt=""><br>And for example, <strong>flipping it horizontally</strong> and adding that also with your training set. So now instead of just this one example in your training set, you can add this to your training example. So by flipping the images horizontally, you could double the size of your training set. <strong>Because you’re training set is now a bit redundant this isn’t as good as if you had collected an additional set of brand new independent examples. But you could do this Without needing to pay the expense of going out to take more pictures of cats.</strong> And then other than flipping horizontally, you can <strong>also take random crops of the image</strong>. So here we’re <strong>rotated and sort of randomly zoom into the image</strong> and this still looks like a cat. <strong>So by taking random distortions and translations of the image you could augment your data set and make additional fake training examples. Again, these extra fake training examples they don’t add as much information as they were to call. They get a brand new independent example of a cat. But because you can do this, almost for free, other than for some confrontational costs. This can be an inexpensive way to give your algorithm more data and therefore sort of regularize it and reduce overfitting.</strong> And by synthesizing examples like this what you’re really telling your algorithm is that If something is a cat then flipping it horizontally is still a cat. Notice I didn’t flip it vertically, because maybe we don’t want upside down cats, right? And then also maybe randomly zooming in to part of the image it’s probably still a cat. </p>
<h4 id="optical-character-recognition"><a href="#optical-character-recognition" class="headerlink" title="optical character recognition"></a>optical character recognition</h4><p>For optical character recognition you can also bring your data set by taking digits and <strong>imposing random rotations and distortions to it</strong>. So If you add these things to your training set, these are also still digit force. For illustration I applied a very strong distortion. So this look very wavy for, in practice you don’t need to distort the four quite as aggressively, but just a more subtle distortion than what I’m showing here, to make this example clearer for you, right? But a more subtle distortion is usually used in practice, because this looks like really warped fours. So data augmentation can be used as a regularization technique, in fact similar to regularization. </p>
<h4 id="early-stopping"><a href="#early-stopping" class="headerlink" title="early stopping"></a>early stopping</h4><p>There’s one other technique that is often used called early stopping. So what you’re going to do is as you run gradient descent you’re going to plot your, either the training error, you’ll use 01 classification error on the training set. Or just plot the cost function J optimizing, and that should decrease monotonically, like so, all right? Because as you trade, hopefully, you’re trading around your cost function J should decrease. So with early stopping, what you do is you plot this, and you also plot your dev set error. And again, this could be a classification error in a development sense, or something like the cost function, like the logistic loss or the log loss of the dev set. Now what you find is that your dev set error will usually go down for a while, and then it will increase from there.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/23.png" alt=""><br>So what early stopping does is, you will say well, it looks like your neural network was doing best around that iteration, so we just want to stop trading on your neural network halfway and take whatever value achieved this dev set error. So why does this work? Well when you’ve haven’t run many iterations for your neural network yet your parameters w will be close to zero. Because with random initialization you probably initialize w to small random values so before you train for a long time, w is still quite small. And as you iterate, as you train, w will get bigger and bigger and bigger until here maybe you have a much larger value of the parameters w for your neural network. <strong>So what early stopping does is by stopping halfway you have only a mid-size rate w. And so similar to L2 regularization by picking a neural network with smaller norm for your parameters w, hopefully your neural network is over fitting less. And the term early stopping refers to the fact that you’re just stopping the training of your neural network earlier</strong>. I sometimes use early stopping when training a neural network. </p>
<p>But it does have <strong>one downside</strong>, let me explain. I think of the <strong>machine learning process as comprising several different steps</strong>. One, is that you want an algorithm to optimize the cost function j and we have various tools to do that, such as gradient descent. And then we’ll talk later about other algorithms, like <strong>momentum and RMSprop and Adam and so on</strong>. But after optimizing the cost function j, you also wanted to not over-fit. And we have some tools to do that such as your regularization, getting more data and so on. <strong>Now in machine learning, we already have so many hyper-parameters</strong>. It surge over. It’s already very complicated to choose among the space of possible algorithms. And so I find machine learning easier to think about when you have one set of tools for optimizing the cost function J, and when you’re focusing on optimizing the cost function J. All you care about is finding w and b, so that J(w,b) is as small as possible. You just don’t think about anything else other than reducing this. And then it’s completely separate task to not over fit, in other words, to reduce variance. And when you’re doing that, you have a separate set of tools for doing it. And this principle is sometimes called <strong>orthogonalization</strong>. <strong>And there’s this idea, that you want to be able to think about one task at a time</strong>. I’ll say more about orthorganization in a later video, so if you don’t fully get the concept yet, don’t worry about it. </p>
<p><strong>But to me the main downside of early stopping is that this couples, these two tasks. So you no longer can work on these two problems independently, because by stopping gradient decent early, you’re sort of breaking whatever you’re doing to optimize cost function J, because now you’re not doing a great job reducing the cost function J. You’ve sort of not done that that well. And then you also simultaneously trying to not over fit. So instead of using different tools to solve the two problems, you’re using one that kind of mixes the two. And this just makes the set of things you could try are more complicated to think about</strong>. </p>
<p>Rather than using early stopping, one alternative is just use <strong>L2 regularization</strong> then you can just train the neural network as long as possible. <strong>I find that this makes the search space of hyper parameters easier to decompose, and easier to search over. But the downside of this though is that you might have to try a lot of values of the regularization parameter lambda. And so this makes searching over many values of lambda more computationally expensive</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>And the advantage of early stopping is that running the gradient descent process just once, you get to try out values of small w, mid-size w, and large w, without needing to try a lot of values of the L2 regularization hyperparameter lambda</strong>. If this concept doesn’t completely make sense to you yet, don’t worry about it. We’re going to talk about orthogonalization in greater detail in a later video, I think this will make a bit more sense. Despite it’s disadvantages, many people do use it. <strong>I personally prefer to just use L2 regularization and try different values of lambda. That’s assuming you can afford the computation to do so. But early stopping does let you get</strong> a similar effect <strong>without needing to explicitly try lots of different values of lambda</strong>. </p>
<p>So you’ve now seen how to use data augmentation as well as if you wish early stopping in order to reduce variance or prevent over fitting your neural network. Next let’s talk about some techniques for setting up your optimization problem to make your training go quickly. </p>
<h2 id="03-setting-up-your-optimization-problem"><a href="#03-setting-up-your-optimization-problem" class="headerlink" title="03_setting-up-your-optimization-problem"></a>03_setting-up-your-optimization-problem</h2><h3 id="01-normalizing-inputs"><a href="#01-normalizing-inputs" class="headerlink" title="01_normalizing-inputs"></a>01_normalizing-inputs</h3><p>When training a neural network, one of the techniques that will speed up your training is if you normalize your inputs. Let’s see what that means.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/24.png" alt=""><br>Let’s see if a training sets with two input features. So the input features x are two dimensional, and here’s a scatter plot of your training set. <strong>Normalizing your inputs corresponds to two steps. The first is to subtract out or to zero out the mean</strong>. So you set $\mu = \dfrac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}x^{(i)}$. So this is a vector, and then $x : =x-\mu$ for every training example, so this means you just move the training set until it has 0 mean. <strong>And then the second step is to normalize the variances</strong>. So notice here that the feature X1 has a much larger variance than the feature X2 here. So what we do is set $\sigma^{2} = \dfrac{1}{m}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}x^{(i)^{2}}$, <code>sigma_square = np.sum(Xi**2)</code> in python. I guess this is a element y squaring. And so now sigma squared is a vector with the variances of each of the features, and notice we’ve already subtracted out the mean, so Xi squared, element y squared is just the variances. And you take each example and divide it by this vector sigma squared. And so in pictures, you end up with this. Where now the variance of X1 and X2 are both equal to one. </p>
<p>And one tip, if you use this to scale your training data, then use the same mu and sigma squared to normalize your test set, right? In particular, you don’t want to normalize the training set and the test set differently. <strong>Whatever this value $\mu$ is and whatever this value $\alpha$ is, use them in these two formulas so that you scale your test set in exactly the same way, rather than estimating mu and sigma squared separately on your training set and test set. Because you want your data, both training and test examples, to go through the same transformation defined by the same mu and sigma squared calculated on your training data</strong>. </p>
<p>So, why do we do this? Why do we want to normalize the input features? Recall that a cost function is defined as written on the top right. It turns out that if you use unnormalized input features, it’s more likely that your cost function will look like this, it’s a very squished out bowl, <strong>very elongated cost function</strong>, where the minimum you’re trying to find is maybe over there.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/25.png" alt=""><br>But if your features are on very different scales, say the feature X1 ranges from 1 to 1,000, and the feature X2 ranges from 0 to 1, then it turns out that the ratio or the range of values for the parameters w1 and w2 will end up taking on very different values. And so maybe these axes should be w1 and w2, but I’ll plot w and b, then your cost function can be a very elongated bowl like that. <strong>So if you part the contours of this function, you can have a very elongated function like that. Whereas if you normalize the features, then your cost function will on average look more symmetric</strong>. And if you’re running gradient descent on the cost function like the one on the left, then you might have to use a very small learning rate because if you’re here that gradient descent might need a lot of steps to oscillate back and forth before it finally finds its way to the minimum.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/25.png" alt=""><br><strong>Whereas if you have a more spherical contours, then wherever you start gradient descent can pretty much go straight to the minimum. You can take much larger steps with gradient descent rather than needing to oscillate around like like the picture on the left</strong>. </p>
<p>Of course in practice w is a high-dimensional vector, and so trying to plot this in 2D doesn’t convey all the intuitions correctly. But the rough intuition that your cost function will be more round and easier to optimize when your features are all on similar scales. Not from one to 1000, zero to one, but mostly from minus one to one or of about similar variances of each other. That just makes your cost function J easier and faster to optimize. In practice if one feature, say X1, ranges from zero to one, and X2 ranges from minus one to one, and X3 ranges from one to two, these are fairly similar ranges, so this will work just fine. It’s when they’re on dramatically different ranges like ones from 1 to a 1000, and the another from 0 to 1, that that really hurts your optimization algorithm. But <strong>by just setting all of them to a 0 mean and say, variance 1, like we did in the last slide, that just guarantees that all your features on a similar scale and will usually help your learning algorithm run faster</strong>. So, if your input features came from very different scales, maybe some features are from 0 to 1, some from 1 to 1,000, then it’s important to normalize your features. <strong>If your features came in on similar scales, then this step is less important. Although performing this type of normalization pretty much never does any harm, so I’ll often do it anyway if I’m not sure whether or not it will help with speeding up training for your algebra</strong>. </p>
<p>So that’s it for normalizing your input features. Next, let’s keep talking about ways to speed up the training of your new network. </p>
<h3 id="02-vanishing-exploding-gradients"><a href="#02-vanishing-exploding-gradients" class="headerlink" title="02_vanishing-exploding-gradients"></a>02_vanishing-exploding-gradients</h3><p>One of the problems of training neural network, especially very deep neural networks, is <strong>vanishing and exploding gradients</strong>. What that means is that <strong>when you’re training a very deep network your derivatives or your slopes can sometimes get either very, very big or very, very small, maybe even exponentially small, and this makes training difficult</strong>. In this video you see what this problem of exploding and vanishing gradients really means, as well as how you can use careful choices of the random weight initialization to significantly reduce this problem. </p>
<p>let’s say you’re training a very deep neural network like this, to save space on the slide, I’ve drawn it as if you have only two hidden units per layer, but it could be more as well. But this neural network will have parameters W1, W2, W3 and so on up to WL.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/26.png" alt=""><br>For the sake of simplicity, let’s say we’re using an activaton function $g(z) = z, b = 0$, so linear activation function. So in that case you can show that the output $\hat{y} = W^{[L]}\times W^{[L-1]}\times\cdots\times W^{[2]}\times W^{[1]}X$. Now, let’s say that <strong>each of you weight matrices $W^{[L]}$ is just a little bit larger than one times the identity</strong>. For example, it’s $W^{[l]}=\left[ \begin{array}{l} 1.5 &amp; 0 \ 0 &amp; 1.5\end{array} \right]$ . Technically, the last one has different dimensions so maybe this is just the rest of these weight matrices. Then Y-hat will be,  $\hat y = W^{[L]}\left[ \begin{array}{l}1.5 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1.5\end{array} \right]^{L-1}X$, because we assume that each one of these matrices is equal to this thing. It’s really 1.5 times the identity matrix, then you end up with this calculation, $\hat y = W^{[L]}1.5^{L-1}\left[ \begin{array}{l} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1\end{array} \right]X $. And so Y-hat will be essentially $\hat y = W^{[L]}1.5^{L-1}X$, and <strong>if L was large for very deep neural network, Y-hat will be very large. In fact, it just grows exponentially, it grows like 1.5 to the number of layers. And so if you have a very deep neural network, the value of Y will explode</strong>. </p>
<p>Now, conversely, if we replace 1.5 with 0.5, so something less than 1, then this becomes 0.5 to the power of L. This matrix becomes $\hat y = W^{[L]}0.5^{L-1}X$. <strong>And so each of your matrices are less than 1</strong>, then let’s say X1, X2 were one one, then the activations will be one half, one half, one fourth, one fourth, one eighth, one eighth, and so on until this becomes one over two to the L.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/27.png" alt=""><br><strong>So the activation values will decrease exponentially as a function of the def, as a function of the number of layers L of the network. So in the very deep network, the activations end up decreasing exponentially</strong>. </p>
<p>So the intuition I hope you can take away from this is that at <strong>the weights W, if they’re all just a little bit bigger than one or just a little bit bigger than the identity matrix, then with a very deep network the activations can explode. And if W is just a little bit less than identity. So this maybe here’s 0.9, 0.9, then you have a very deep network, the activations will decrease exponentially</strong>. </p>
<p>And even though I went through this argument in terms of activations increasing or decreasing exponentially as a function of L, a similar argument can be used to show that the derivatives or the gradients the computer is going to send will also increase exponentially or decrease exponentially as a function of the number of layers. With some of the modern neural networks, L equals 150. Microsoft recently got great results with 152 layer neural network. <strong>But with such a deep neural network, if your activations or gradients increase or decrease exponentially as a function of L, then these values could get really big or really small. And this makes training difficult, especially if your gradients are exponentially smaller than L, then gradient descent will take tiny little steps. It will take a long time for gradient descent to learn anything</strong>. </p>
<p>To summarize, you’ve seen how deep networks suffer from the problems of vanishing or exploding gradients. In fact, for a long time this problem was a huge barrier to training deep neural networks. <strong>It turns out there’s a partial solution that doesn’t completely solve this problem but it helps a lot which is careful choice of how you initialize the weights</strong>. To see that, let’s go to the next video.</p>
<h3 id="03-weight-initialization-for-deep-networks"><a href="#03-weight-initialization-for-deep-networks" class="headerlink" title="03_weight-initialization-for-deep-networks"></a>03_weight-initialization-for-deep-networks</h3><p>In the last video you saw how very deep neural networks can have the problems of vanishing and exploding gradients. It turns out that a partial solution to this, doesn’t solve it entirely but helps a lot, is better or more careful choice of the random initialization for your neural network. To understand this lets start with the example of initializing the ways for a single neuron and then we’re going to generalize this to a deep network.</p>
<p>Let’s go through this with an example with just a single neuron and then we’ll talk about the deep net later. So a single neuron you might input four features x1 through x4 and then you have some a=g(z) and end it up with some y and later on for a deeper net you know these inputs will be right, some layer a(l), but for now let’s just call this x for now. So z is going to be equal to w1x1 + w2x2 +… + it goes WnXn and let’s set b=0 so you know lets just ignore b for now. <strong>So in order to make z not blow up and not become too small you notice that the larger n is, the smaller you want Wi to be, right?</strong><br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/28.png" alt=""><br>Because z is the sum of the WiXi and so if you’re adding up a lot of these terms you want each of these terms to be smaller. <strong>One reasonable thing to do would be to set the variance of Wi to be equal to 1 over n, $Variance(W^{[i]}) = {1 \over n}$, where n is the number of input features that’s going into a neuron</strong>. So in practice, what you can do is set the weight matrix <code>WL = np.random.randn(WL.shape[0],WL.shape[1]) * np.sqrt(1/n)</code> whose n is the number of features that I fed into each neuron and there else is going to be $n^{(l-1)}$ because that’s the number of units that I’m feeding into each of the units and they are l. <strong>It turns out that if you’re using a ReLU activation function, to set in the variance that 2 over n works a little bit better.</strong> </p>
<p>So you often see that in initialization especially if you’re using a ReLU activation function so if g(z) is ReLu(z), oh and it depend on how familiar you are with random variables. It turns out that something, a Gaussian random variable and then multiplying it by a square root of this, that says the variance to be quoted this way, to be to 2 over n.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/29.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And <strong>the reason I went from n to this n superscript l-1 was, in this example with logistic regression which is to input features but the more general case they are l would have an l-1 inputs each of the units in that layer</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>So if the input features of activations are roughly mean 0 and standard variance and variance 1 then this would cause z to also take on a similar scale and this doesn’t solve, but it definitely helps reduce the vanishing, exploding gradients problem because it’s trying to set each of the weight matrices w not too much bigger than 1 and not too much less than 1 so it doesn’t explode or vanish too quickly</strong>. </p>
<p>I’ve just mention some other variants. <strong>The version we just described is assuming a <code>ReLU</code> activation function and this by a paper by Herd at al. A few other variants, if you are using a <code>tanh</code> activation function then there’s a paper that shows that instead of using the constant 2 it’s better use the constant 1 and so 1 over this instead of 2 and so you multiply it by the square root of this</strong>. So this square root term will plays this term and you use this if you’re using a TanH activation function. This is called <strong>Xavier initialization</strong>.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/30.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And another version we’re taught by Yoshua Bengio and his colleagues, you might see in some papers, but is to use this formula, $\sqrt{\frac{2}{n^{[l-1]}+n^{[l]}}}$, which you know has some other theoretical justification. But I would say if you’re using a <code>ReLU</code> activation function, which is really the most common activation function, I would use this formula, $\sqrt{\frac{2}{n^{[l-1]}}}$ . If you’re using <code>tanh</code> you could try this version, $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n^{[l-1]}}}$, instead and some authors will also use $\sqrt{\frac{2}{n^{[l-1]}}}$, <strong>But in practice I think all of these formulas just give you a starting point, it gives you a default value to use for the variance of the initialization of your weight matrices</strong>. If you wish the variance here, this variance parameter could be another thing that you could tune of your hyperparameters so you could have another parameter that multiplies into this formula (pointed by the green arrow) and <strong>tune that multiplier</strong> as part of your hyperparameter surge.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/31.png" alt=""><br>Sometimes tuning the hyperparameter has a modest size effect. <em>It’s not one of the first hyperparameters I would usually try to tune but I’ve also seen some problems with tuning this you know helps a reasonable amount but this is usually lower down for me in terms of how important it is relative to the other hyperparameters you can tune</em>. </p>
<p>So I hope that gives you some intuition about the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients as well as how choosing a reasonable scaling for how you initialize the weights. Hopefully that makes your weights you know not explode too quickly and not decay to zero too quickly so you can train a reasonably deep network without the weights or the gradients exploding or vanishing too much. When you train deep networks this is another trick that will help you make your neural networks trained much.</p>
<h3 id="04-numerical-approximation-of-gradients"><a href="#04-numerical-approximation-of-gradients" class="headerlink" title="04_numerical-approximation-of-gradients"></a>04_numerical-approximation-of-gradients</h3><p>When you implement back propagation you’ll find that there’s a test called <strong>creating checking that can really help you make sure that your implementation of back prop is correct</strong>. Because sometimes you write all these equations and you’re just not 100% sure if you’ve got all the details right and internal back propagation. So in order to build up to gradient and checking, let’s first talk about how to numerically approximate computations of gradients and in the next video, we’ll talk about how you can implement gradient checking to make sure the implementation of backdrop is correct. </p>
<h4 id="one-sided-difference"><a href="#one-sided-difference" class="headerlink" title="one sided difference"></a>one sided difference</h4><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/32.png" alt=""><br>So lets take the function f and replot it here and remember this is f of theta equals theta cubed, and let’s again start off to some value of theta. Let’s say theta equals 1. Now instead of just nudging theta to the right to get theta plus epsilon, we’re going to nudge it to the right and nudge it to the left to get theta minus epsilon, as was theta plus epsilon. So this is 1, this is 1.01, this is 0.99 where, again, epsilon is same as before, it is 0.01. It turns out that rather than taking this little triangle and computing the height over the width, you can get a much better estimate of the gradient if you take this point, f of theta minus epsilon and this point, and you instead compute the height over width of this bigger triangle. So for technical reasons which I won’t go into, the height over width of this bigger green triangle gives you a much better approximation to the derivative at theta. And you saw it yourself, taking just this lower triangle in the upper right is as if you have two triangles, right? This one on the upper right and this one on the lower left. And you’re kind of taking both of them into account by using this bigger green triangle. </p>
<h4 id="two-sided-difference"><a href="#two-sided-difference" class="headerlink" title="two sided difference"></a>two sided difference</h4><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/33.png" alt=""><br>So rather than a one sided difference, you’re taking a two sided difference. So let’s work out the math. This point here is F of theta plus epsilon. This point here is F of theta minus epsilon. So the height of this big green triangle is f of theta plus epsilon minus f of theta minus epsilon. And then the width, this is 1 epsilon, this is 2 epsilon. So the width of this green triangle is 2 epsilon. So the height of the width is going to be first the height, so that’s F of theta plus epsilon minus F of theta minus epsilon divided by the width. So that was 2 epsilon which we write that down here. And this should hopefully be close to g of theta. So plug in the values, remember f of theta is theta cubed. So this is theta plus epsilon is 1.01. So I take a cube of that minus 0.99 theta cube of that divided by 2 times 0.01. Feel free to pause the video and practice in the calculator. You should get that this is 3.0001. Whereas from the previous slide, we saw that g of theta, this was 3 theta squared so when theta was 1, so these two values are actually very close to each other. The approximation error is now 0.0001. Whereas on the previous slide, we’ve taken the one sided of difference just theta + theta + epsilon we had gotten 3.0301 and so the approximation error was 0.03 rather than 0.0001. So this two sided difference way of approximating the derivative you find that this is extremely close to 3. And so this gives you a much greater confidence that g of theta is probably a correct implementation of the derivative of F. When you use this method for grading, checking and back propagation, this turns out to run twice as slow as you were to use a one-sided difference. It turns out that in practice I think it’s worth it to use this other method because it’s just much more accurate. The little bit of optional theory for those of you that are a little bit more familiar of Calculus, it turns out that, and it’s okay if you don’t get what I’m about to say here. But it turns out that the formal definition of a derivative is for very small values of epsilon is f of theta plus epsilon minus f of theta minus epsilon over 2 epsilon. And the formal definition of derivative is in the limits of exactly that formula on the right as epsilon those as 0. And the definition of unlimited is something that you learned if you took a Calculus class but I won’t go into that here. <strong>And it turns out that for a non zero value of epsilon, you can show that the error of this approximation, $f’(\theta) = \frac{f(\theta+\epsilon)-f(\theta-\epsilon)}{\epsilon}$ , is on the order of epsilon squared, $O(\epsilon^2)$, and remember epsilon is a very small number</strong>. So if epsilon is 0.01 which it is here then epsilon squared is 0.0001. <strong>The big O notation means the error is actually some constant times this, but this is actually exactly our approximation error. So the big O constant happens to be 1</strong>. <strong>Whereas in contrast if we were to use this formula, $f’(\theta) = \frac{f(\theta - \epsilon)}{\epsilon}$, the other one, then the error is on the order of epsilon $O(\epsilon)$.</strong> </p>
<p>And again, <strong>when epsilon is a number less than 1, then epsilon is actually much bigger than epsilon squared which is why this formula here is actually much less accurate approximation than this formula on the left. Which is why when doing gradient checking, we rather use this two-sided difference when you compute $f’(\theta) = \frac{f(\theta+\epsilon)-f(\theta-\epsilon)}{\epsilon}$ rather than just one sided difference, $f’(\theta) = \frac{f(\theta - \epsilon)}{\epsilon}$, which is less accurate</strong>.</p>
<p>If you didn’t understand my last two comments, all of these things are on here. Don’t worry about it. That’s really more for those of you that are a bit more familiar with Calculus, and with numerical approximations. But the takeaway is that this two-sided difference formula is much more accurate. </p>
<p>And so that’s what we’re going to use when we do gradient checking in the next video. So you’ve seen how by taking a two sided difference, you can numerically verify whether or not a function g, g of theta that someone else gives you is a correct implementation of the derivative of a function f. <strong>Let’s now see how we can use this to verify whether or not your back propagation implementation is correct or if there might be a bug in there that you need to go and tease out</strong> </p>
<h3 id="05-gradient-checking"><a href="#05-gradient-checking" class="headerlink" title="05_gradient-checking"></a>05_gradient-checking</h3><p>Gradient checking is a technique that’s helped me save tons of time, and helped me find bugs in my implementations of back propagation many times. Let’s see how you could use it too to debug, or to verify that your implementation and back process correct. </p>
<p>So your new network will have some sort of parameters, W1, B1 and so on up to WL bL. So to implement gradient checking, the first thing you should do is take all your parameters and reshape them into a giant vector data. So what you should do is take W which is a matrix, and reshape it into a vector. You gotta take all of these Ws and reshape them into vectors, and then concatenate all of these things, so that you have a giant vector theta. Giant vector pronounced as theta. So we say that the cos function J being a function of the Ws and Bs, You would now have the cost function J being just a function of theta. Next, with W and B ordered the same way, you can also take dW[1], db[1] and so on, and initiate them into big, giant vector d theta of the same dimension as theta. So same as before, we shape dW[1] into the matrix, db[1] is already a vector. We shape dW[L], all of the dW’s which are matrices. Remember, dW1 has the same dimension as W1. db1 has the same dimension as b1. So the same sort of reshaping and concatenation operation, you can then reshape all of these derivatives into a giant vector d theta. Which has the same dimension as theta.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/36.png" alt=""><br><strong>So the question is, now, is the theta the gradient or the slope of the cost function J</strong>? So here’s how you implement gradient checking, and often abbreviate gradient checking to grad check. So first we remember that J Is now a function of the giant parameter, theta, right? So expands to j is a function of theta 1, theta 2, theta 3, and so on. Whatever’s the dimension of this giant parameter vector theta. </p>
<p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/37.png" alt=""><br><strong>So to implement grad check, what you’re going to do is implements a loop so that for each I, so for each component of theta, let’s compute D theta approx i to b. And let me take a two sided difference</strong>. So I’ll take J of theta. Theta 1, theta 2, up to theta i. And we’re going to nudge theta i to add epsilon to this. So just increase theta i by epsilon, and keep everything else the same. And because we’re taking a two sided difference, we’re going to do the same on the other side with theta i, but now minus epsilon. And then all of the other elements of theta are left alone. And then we’ll take this, and we’ll divide it by 2 theta. And what we saw from the previous video is that this should be approximately equal to d theta i. Of which is supposed to be the partial derivative of J or of respect to, I guess theta i, if d theta i is the derivative of the cost function J. So what you going to do is you’re going to compute to this for every value of i. And at the end, you now end up with two vectors. You end up with this d theta approx, and this is going to be the same dimension as d theta. And both of these are in turn the same dimension as theta. <strong>And what you want to do is check if these vectors , $d_{approx}\theta, d\theta $, are approximately equal to each other</strong>. </p>
<p>So, in detail, well <strong>how you do you define whether or not two vectors are really reasonably close to each other? What I do is the following. I would compute the Euclidean distance between these two vectors</strong>, d theta approx minus d theta, so just the Euclidean norm of this. Notice there’s no square on top, so this is the sum of squares of elements of the differences, and then you take a square root, as you get the <strong>Euclidean distance</strong>. And then just to normalize by the lengths of these vectors, divide by d theta approx plus d theta. Just take the Euclidean lengths of these vectors. <strong>And the row for the denominator is just in case any of these vectors are really small or really large, your the denominator turns this formula into a ratio</strong>.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/38.png" alt=""><br>So we implement this in practice, I use epsilon equals maybe 10 to the minus 7, so minus 7. And with this range of epsilon, if you find that <strong>this formula gives you a value like 10 to the minus 7 or smaller, then that’s great. It means that your derivative approximation is very likely correct</strong>. This is just a very small value. <strong>If it’s maybe on the range of 10 to the -5, I would take a careful look. Maybe this is okay. But I might double-check the components of this vector, and make sure that none of the components are too large. And if some of the components of this difference are very large, then maybe you have a bug somewhere. And if this formula on the left is on the other is -3, then I would wherever you have would be much more concerned that maybe there’s a bug somewhere. But you should really be getting values much smaller then 10 minus 3. If any bigger than 10 to minus 3, then I would be quite concerned. I would be seriously worried that there might be a bug</strong>. And I would then, you should then look at the individual components of data to see if there’s a specific value of i for which d theta across i is very different from d theta i. And use that to try to track down whether or not some of your derivative computations might be incorrect. And after some amounts of debugging, it finally, it ends up being this kind of very small value, then you probably have a correct implementation. </p>
<p>So when implementing a neural network, what often happens is I’ll implement foreprop, implement backprop. And then I might find that this grad check has a relatively big value. And then I will suspect that there must be a bug, go in debug, debug, debug. And after debugging for a while, If I find that it passes grad check with a small value, then you can be much more confident that it’s then correct. </p>
<p>So you now know how gradient checking works. This has helped me find lots of bugs in my implementations of neural nets, and I hope it’ll help you too. In the next video, I want to share with you some tips or some notes on how to actually implement gradient checking. Let’s go onto the next video. </p>
<h3 id="06-gradient-checking-implementation-notes"><a href="#06-gradient-checking-implementation-notes" class="headerlink" title="06_gradient-checking-implementation-notes"></a>06_gradient-checking-implementation-notes</h3><p>In the last video you learned about gradient checking. In this video, I want to share with you some practical tips or some notes on how to actually go about implementing this for your neural network.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/deep-neural-network/01_practical-aspects-of-deep-learning/39.png" alt=""><br><strong>First</strong>, don’t use grad check in training, only to debug. So what I mean is that, computing d theta approx i, for all the values of i, this is a very slow computation. So to implement gradient descent, you’d use backprop to compute d theta and just use backprop to compute the derivative. And it’s only when you’re debugging that you would compute this to make sure it’s close to d theta. But once you’ve done that, then you would turn off the grad check, and don’t run this during every iteration of gradient descent, because that’s just much too slow. </p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, if an algorithm fails grad check, look at the components, look at the individual components, and try to identify the bug. So what I mean by that is if d theta approx is very far from d theta, what I would do is look at the different values of i to see which are the values of d theta approx that are really very different than the values of d theta. So for example, if you find that the values of theta or d theta, they’re very far off, all correspond to dbl for some layer or for some layers, but the components for dw are quite close, right? Remember, different components of theta correspond to different components of b and w. When you find this is the case, then maybe you find that the bug is in how you’re computing db, the derivative with respect to parameters b. And similarly, vice versa, if you find that the values that are very far, the values from d theta approx that are very far from d theta, you find all those components came from dw or from dw in a certain layer, then that might help you hone in on the location of the bug. This doesn’t always let you identify the bug right away, but sometimes it helps you give you some guesses about where to track down the bug. </p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>, when doing grad check, remember your regularization term if you’re using regularization. So if your cost function is J of theta equals 1 over m sum of your losses and then plus this regularization term. And sum over l of wl squared, <strong>then this is the definition of J. And you should have that d theta is gradient of J with respect to theta, including this regularization term. So just remember to include that term</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Next</strong>, grad check doesn’t work with dropout, because in every iteration, dropout is randomly eliminating different subsets of the hidden units. There isn’t an easy to compute cost function J that dropout is doing gradient descent on. It turns out that dropout can be viewed as optimizing some cost function J, but it’s cost function J defined by summing over all exponentially large subsets of nodes they could eliminate in any iteration. So the cost function J is very difficult to compute, and you’re just sampling the cost function every time you eliminate different random subsets in those we use dropout. So it’s difficult to use grad check to double check your computation with dropouts. So what I usually do is implement grad check without dropout. So if you want, you can set keep-prob and dropout to be equal to 1.0. And then turn on dropout and hope that my implementation of dropout was correct. There are some other things you could do, like fix the pattern of nodes dropped and verify that grad check for that pattern of [INAUDIBLE] is correct, but in practice I don’t usually do that. <strong>So my recommendation is turn off dropout, use grad check to double check that your algorithm is at least correct without dropout, and then turn on dropout.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, this is a subtlety. It is not impossible, rarely happens, but it’s not impossible that your implementation of gradient descent is correct when w and b are close to 0, so at random initialization. But that as you run gradient descent and w and b become bigger, maybe your implementation of backprop is correct only when w and b is close to 0, but it gets more inaccurate when w and b become large. So one thing you could do, I don’t do this very often, but one thing you could do is run grad check at random initialization and then train the network for a while so that w and b have some time to wander away from 0, from your small random initial values. And then run grad check again after you’ve trained for some number of iterations. So that’s it for gradient checking. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion-of-this-week"><a href="#conclusion-of-this-week" class="headerlink" title="conclusion of this week"></a>conclusion of this week</h2><p>And congratulations for coming to the end of this week’s materials. In this week, you’ve learned about how to set up your train, dev, and test sets, how to analyze bias and variance and what things to do if you have high bias versus high variance versus maybe high bias and high variance. You also saw how to apply different forms of regularization, like L2 regularization and dropout on your neural network. So some tricks for speeding up the training of your neural network. And then finally, gradient checking. So I think you’ve seen a lot in this week and you get to exercise a lot of these ideas in this week’s programming exercise. So best of luck with that, and I look forward to seeing you in the week two materials. </p>
