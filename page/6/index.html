          <h2 id="Note"><a href="#Note" class="headerlink" title="Note"></a>Note</h2><p>This is my personal note after studying the course of the 2nd week <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convolutional neural networks</a> and the copyright belongs to <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deeplearning.ai</a>.</p><h2 id="01-case-studies"><a href="#01-case-studies" class="headerlink" title="01_case-studies"></a>01_case-studies</h2><h3 id="01-why-look-at-case-studies"><a href="#01-why-look-at-case-studies" class="headerlink" title="01_why-look-at-case-studies"></a>01_why-look-at-case-studies</h3><p>Hello and welcome back. <strong>This week the first thing we’ll do is show you a number of case studies of the factor convolutional neural networks</strong>. So why look at case studies? Last week we learned about the basic building blocks such as convolutional layers, proving layers and fully connected layers of conv nets. It turns out a lot of the past few years of computer vision research has been on how to put together these basic building blocks to form effective convolutional neural networks. And one of the best ways for you to get intuition yourself is to see some of these examples. I think just as many of you may have learned to write codes by reading other people’s codes, I think that a good way to get intuition on how to build conv nets is to read or to see other examples of effective conv nets. And it turns out that a net neural network architecture that works well on one computer vision task often works well on other tasks as well such as maybe on your task. So if someone else is training neural network as speak it out in your network architecture is very good at recognizing cats and dogs and people but you have a different computer vision task like maybe you’re trying to sell self-driving car. You might well be able to take someone else’s neural network architecture and apply that to your problem. And finally, after the next few videos, you’ll be able to read some of the research papers from the theater computer vision and I hope that you might find it satisfying as well. You don’t have to do this as a class but I hope you might find it satisfying to be able to read some of these seminal computer vision research paper and see yourself able to understand them. So with that, let’s get started.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/1.png" alt=""><br>As an outline of what we’ll do in the next few videos, we’ll first show you a few classic networks.</p><p><strong>The LeNEt-5 network which came from, I guess, in 1980s, AlexNet which is often cited and the VGG network and these are examples of pretty effective neural networks. And some of the ideas lay the foundation for modern computer vision. And you see ideas in these papers that are probably useful for your own. And you see ideas from these papers that were probably be useful for your own work as well</strong>.</p><p>Then I want to show you the ResNet or conv residual network and you might have heard that neural networks are getting deeper and deeper. The <strong>ResNet neural network</strong> trained a very, very deep 152-layer neural network that has some very interesting tricks, interesting ideas how to do that effectively.</p><p>And then finally you also see a case study of the <strong>Inception neural network</strong>. After seeing these neural networks, l think you have much better intuition about how to built effective convolutional neural networks. <strong>And even if you end up not working computer vision yourself, I think you find a lot of the ideas from some of these examples, such as ResNet Inception network, many of these ideas are cross-fertilizing on making their way into other disciplines</strong>. So even if you don’t end up building computer vision applications yourself, I think you’ll find some of these ideas very interesting and helpful for your work.</p><h3 id="02-classic-networks"><a href="#02-classic-networks" class="headerlink" title="02_classic-networks"></a>02_classic-networks</h3><p>In this video, you’ll learn about some of the classic neural network architecture starting with LeNet-5, and then AlexNet, and then VGGNet. Let’s take a look.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/2.png" alt=""><br>Here is the LeNet-5 architecture. You start off with an image which say, 32 by 32 by 1. And the goal of <strong>LeNet-5</strong> was to recognize handwritten digits, so maybe an image of a digits like that. And LeNet-5 was trained on grayscale images, which is why it’s 32 by 32 by 1. This neural network architecture is actually quite similar to the last example you saw last week. In the first step, you use a set of six, 5 by 5 filters with a stride of one because you use six filters you end up with a 20 by 20 by 6 over there. And with a stride of one and no padding, the image dimensions reduces from 32 by 32 down to 28 by 28. Then the LeNet neural network applies pooling. And back then when this paper was written, people use average pooling much more. If you’re building a modern variant, you probably use max pooling instead. But in this example, you average pool and with a filter width two and a stride of two, you wind up reducing the dimensions, the height and width by a factor of two, so we now end up with a 14 by 14 by 6 volume. I guess the height and width of these volumes aren’t entirely drawn to scale. Now technically, if I were drawing these volumes to scale, the height and width would be stronger by a factor of two. Next, you apply another convolutional layer. This time you use a set of 16 filters, the 5 by 5, so you end up with 16 channels to the next volume. And back when this paper was written in 1998, people didn’t really use padding or you always using valid convolutions, which is why every time you apply convolutional layer, they heightened with strengths. So that’s why, here, you go from 14 to 14 down to 10 by 10. Then another pooling layer, so that reduces the height and width by a factor of two, then you end up with 5 by 5 over here. And if you multiply all these numbers 5 by 5 by 16, this multiplies up to 400. That’s 25 times 16 is 400. And the next layer is then a fully connected layer that fully connects each of these 400 nodes with every one of 120 neurons, so there’s a fully connected layer. And sometimes, that would draw out exclusively a layer with 400 nodes, I’m skipping that here. There’s a fully connected layer and then another a fully connected layer. And then the final step is it uses these essentially 84 features and uses it with one final output. I guess you could draw one more node here to make a prediction for ŷ. And ŷ took on 10 possible values corresponding to recognising each of the digits from 0 to 9. A modern version of this neural network, we’ll use a softmax layer with a 10 way classification output. Although back then, LeNet-5 actually use a different classifier at the output layer, one that’s useless today. So this neural network was small by modern standards, had about 60,000 parameters. And today, you often see neural networks with anywhere from 10 million to 100 million parameters, and it’s not unusual to see networks that are literally about a thousand times bigger than this network. But one thing you do see is that as you go deeper in a network, so as you go from left to right, the height and width tend to go down. So you went from 32 by 32, to 28 to 14, to 10 to 5, whereas the number of channels does increase. It goes from 1 to 6 to 16 as you go deeper into the layers of the network. One other pattern you see in this neural network that’s still often repeated today is that you might have some one or more conu layers followed by pooling layer, and then one or sometimes more than one conu layer followed by a pooling layer, and then some fully connected layers and then the outputs. So this type of arrangement of layers is quite common.</p><p>Now finally, this is maybe only for those of you that want to try reading the paper. There are a couple other things that were different. The rest of this slide, I’m going to make <strong>a few more advanced comments, only for those of you that want to try to read this classic paper</strong>. And so, everything I’m going to write in red, you can safely skip on the slide, and there’s maybe an interesting historical footnote that is okay if you don’t follow fully. <strong>So it turns out that if you read the original paper, back then, people used sigmoid and tanh nonlinearities, and people weren’t using value nonlinearities back then. So if you look at the paper, you see sigmoid and tanh referred to. And there are also some funny ways about this network was wired that is funny by modern standards</strong>. So for example, you’ve seen how if you have a nh by nw by nc network with nc channels then you use f by f by nc dimensional filter, where everything looks at every one of these channels. <strong>But back then, computers were much slower. And so to save on computation as well as some parameters, the original LeNet-5 had some crazy complicated way where different filters would look at different channels of the input block. And so the paper talks about those details, but the more modern implementation wouldn’t have that type of complexity these days. And then one last thing that was done back then I guess but isn’t really done right now is that the original LeNet-5 had a non-linearity after pooling, and I think it actually uses sigmoid non-linearity after the pooling layer</strong>. So if you do read this paper, and this is one of the harder ones to read than the ones we’ll go over in the next few videos, the next one might be an easy one to start with. <strong>Most of the ideas on the slide I just tried in sections two and three of the paper, and later sections of the paper talked about some other ideas</strong>. It talked about something called the graph transformer network, which isn’t widely used today. So if you do try to read this paper, I recommend focusing really on section two which talks about this architecture, and maybe take a quick look at section three which has a bunch of experiments and results, which is pretty interesting.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/3.png" alt=""><br>The second example of a neural network I want to show you is AlexNet, named after Alex Krizhevsky, who was the first author of the paper describing this work. The other author’s were Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton. So, AlexNet input starts with 227 by 227 by 3 images. And if you read the paper, the paper refers to 224 by 224 by 3 images. But if you look at the numbers, I think that the numbers make sense only of actually 227 by 227. And then the first layer applies a set of 96 11 by 11 filters with a stride of four. And because it uses a large stride of four, the dimensions shrinks to 55 by 55. So roughly, going down by a factor of 4 because of a large stride. And then it applies max pooling with a 3 by 3 filter. So f equals three and a stride of two. So this reduces the volume to 27 by 27 by 96, and then it performs a 5 by 5 same convolution, same padding, so you end up with 27 by 27 by 276. Max pooling again, this reduces the height and width to 13. And then another same convolution, so same padding. So it’s 13 by 13 by now 384 filters. And then 3 by 3, same convolution again, gives you that. Then 3 by 3, same convolution, gives you that. Then max pool, brings it down to 6 by 6 by 256. If you multiply all these numbers,6 times 6 times 256, that’s 9216. So we’re going to unroll this into 9216 nodes. And then finally, it has a few fully connected layers. And then finally, it uses a softmax to output which one of 1000 causes the object could be. So this neural network actually had a lot of similarities to LeNet, but it was much bigger. <strong>So whereas the LeNet-5 from previous slide had about 60,000 parameters, this AlexNet that had about 60 million parameters. And the fact that they could take pretty similar basic building blocks that have a lot more hidden units and training on a lot more data, they trained on the image that dataset that allowed it to have a just remarkable performance. Another aspect of this architecture that made it much better than LeNet was using the value activation function</strong>. And then again, just if you read the bay paper some more advanced details that you don’t really need to worry about if you don’t read the paper, one is that, when this paper was written, GPUs was still a little bit slower, so it had a complicated way of training on two GPUs. And the basic idea was that, a lot of these layers was actually split across two different GPUs and there was a thoughtful way for when the two GPUs would communicate with each other. And the paper also, the original AlexNet architecture also had another set of a layer called a Local Response Normalization. And this type of layer isn’t really used much, which is why I didn’t talk about it. But the basic idea of Local Response Normalization is, if you look at one of these blocks, one of these volumes that we have on top, let’s say for the sake of argument, this one, 13 by 13 by 256, what Local Response Normalization, (LRN) does, is you look at one position. So one position height and width, and look down this across all the channels, look at all 256 numbers and normalize them. And the motivation for this Local Response Normalization was that for each position in this 13 by 13 image, maybe you don’t want too many neurons with a very high activation. But subsequently, many researchers have found that this doesn’t help that much so this is one of those ideas I guess I’m drawing in red because it’s less important for you to understand this one. And in practice, I don’t really use local response normalizations really in the networks language trained today. So if you are interested in the history of deep learning, I think even before AlexNet, deep learning was starting to gain traction in speech recognition and a few other areas, but it was really just paper that convinced a lot of the computer vision community to take a serious look at deep learning to convince them that deep learning really works in computer vision. And then it grew on to have a huge impact not just in computer vision but beyond computer vision as well. And if you want to try reading some of these papers yourself and you really don’t have to for this course, but <strong>if you want to try reading some of these papers, this one is one of the easier ones to read so this might be a good one to take a look at</strong>. So whereas AlexNet had a relatively complicated architecture, there’s just a lot of hyperparameters, right? Where you have all these numbers that Alex Krizhevsky and his co-authors had to come up with.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/4.png" alt=""><br>Let me show you a third and final example on this video called the <strong>VGG or VGG-16 network</strong>. And a remarkable thing about the VGG-16 net is that they said, instead of having so many hyperparameters, let’s use a much simpler network <strong>where you focus on just having conv-layers that are just three-by-three filters with a stride of one and always use same padding. And make all your max pooling layers two-by-two with a stride of two. And so, one very nice thing about the VGG network was it really simplified this neural network architectures</strong>. So, let’s go through the architecture. So, you solve up with an image for them and then the first two layers are convolutions, which are therefore these three-by-three filters. And in the first two layers use 64 filters. You end up with a 224 by 224 because using same convolutions and then with 64 channels. So because VGG-16 is a relatively deep network, am going to not draw all the volumes here. So what this little picture denotes is what we would previously have drawn as this 224 by 224 by 3. And then a convolution that results in I guess a 224 by 224 by 64 is to be drawn as a deeper volume, and then another layer that results in 224 by 224 by 64. So this conv64 times two represents that you’re doing two conv-layers with 64 filters. And as I mentioned earlier, the filters are always three-by-three with a stride of one and they are always same convolutions. So rather than drawing all these volumes, am just going to use text to represent this network. Next, then uses are pooling layer, so the pooling layer will reduce. I think it goes from 224 by 224 down to what? Right. Goes to 112 by 112 by 64. And then it has a couple more conv-layers. So this means it has 128 filters and because these are the same convolutions, let’s see what is the new dimension. Right? It will be 112 by 112 by 128 and then pooling layer so you can figure out what’s the new dimension of that. And now, three conv-layers with 256 filters to the pooling layer and then a few more conv-layers, pooling layer, more conv-layers, pooling layer. And then it takes this final 7 by 7 by 512 these in to fully connected layer, fully connected with four thousand ninety six units and then a softmax output one of a thousand classes. <strong>By the way, the 16 in the VGG-16 refers to the fact that this has 16 layers that have weights</strong>. And this is a pretty large network, this network has a total of <strong>about 138 million parameters</strong>. And that’s pretty large even by modern standards. <strong>But the simplicity of the VGG-16 architecture made it quite appealing. You can tell his architecture is really quite uniform. There is a few conv-layers followed by a pulling layer, which reduces the height and width, right? So the pulling layers reduce the height and width. You have a few of them here. But then also, if you look at the number of filters in the conv-layers, here you have 64 filters and then you double to 128 double to 256 doubles to 512. And then I guess the authors thought 512 was big enough and did double on the game here. But this sort of roughly doubling on every step, or doubling through every stack of conv-layers was another simple principle used to design the architecture of this network. And so I think the relative uniformity of this architecture made it quite attractive to researchers</strong>.</p><p><strong>The main downside was that it was a pretty large network in terms of the number of parameters you had to train</strong>. And if you read the literature, you sometimes see people talk about the VGG-19, that is an even bigger version of this network. And you could see the details in the paper cited at the bottom by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman. But because VGG-16 does almost as well as VGG-19. A lot of people will use VGG-16. But <strong>the thing I liked most about this was that, this made this pattern of how, as you go deeper and height and width goes down, it just goes down by a factor of two each time for the pooling layers whereas the number of channels increases. And here roughly goes up by a factor of two every time you have a new set of conv-layers. So by making the rate at which it goes down and that go up very systematic, I thought this paper was very attractive from that perspective</strong>.</p><p>So that’s it for the three classic architecture’s. If you want, you should really now read some of these papers. I recommend starting with the AlexNet paper followed by the VGG net paper and then the LeNet paper is a bit harder to read but it is a good classic once you go over that. But next, let’s go beyond these classic networks and look at some even more advanced, even more powerful neural network architectures. Let’s go into.</p><h3 id="03-resnets"><a href="#03-resnets" class="headerlink" title="03_resnets"></a>03_resnets</h3><p><strong>Very, very deep neural networks are difficult to train because of vanishing and exploding gradient types of problems</strong>. In this video, you’ll learn about <strong>skip connections</strong> which allows you to take the activation from one layer and suddenly feed it to another layer even much deeper in the neural network. And using that, you’ll build ResNet which enables you to train very, very deep networks. Sometimes even networks of over 100 layers. Let’s take a look.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/5.png" alt=""><br>ResNets are built out of something called a residual block, let’s first describe what that is. Here are two layers of a neural network where you start off with some activations in layer a[l], then goes a[l+1] and then deactivation two layers later is a[l+2]. So let’s to through the steps in this computation you have a[l], and then the first thing you do is you apply this linear operator to it, which is governed by this equation. So you go from a[l] to compute z[l +1] by multiplying by the weight matrix and adding that bias vector. After that, you apply the ReLU nonlinearity, to get a[l+1]. And that’s governed by this equation where a[l+1] is g(z[l+1]). Then in the next layer, you apply this linear step again, so is governed by that equation. So this is quite similar to this equation we saw on the left. And then finally, you apply another ReLU operation which is now governed by that equation where G here would be the ReLU nonlinearity. And this gives you a[l+2]. So in other words, for information from a[l] to flow to a[l+2], it needs to go through all of these steps which I’m going to call the main path of this set of layers. In a residual net, we’re going to make a change to this. We’re going to take a[l], and just first forward it, copy it, match further into the neural network to here, and just at a[l], before applying to non-linearity, the ReLU non-linearity. And I’m going to call this the shortcut. So rather than needing to follow the main path, the information from a[l] can now follow a shortcut to go much deeper into the neural network. And what that means is that this last equation goes away and we instead have that the output a[l+2] is the ReLU non-linearity g applied to z[l+2] as before, but now plus a[l]. So, <strong>the addition of this a[l] here, it makes this a residual block</strong>. And in pictures, you can also modify this picture on top by drawing this picture shortcut to go here. And we are going to draw it as it going into this second layer here because the short cut is actually added before the ReLU non-linearity. So each of these nodes here, where there applies a linear function and a ReLU. <em>So a[l] is being injected after the linear part but before the ReLU part</em>. <strong>And sometimes instead of a term short cut, you also hear the term skip connection, and that refers to a[l] just skipping over a layer or kind of skipping over almost two layers in order to process information deeper into the neural network</strong>. So, what the inventors of ResNet, so that’ll will be Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren and Jian Sun. <strong>What they found was that using residual blocks allows you to train much deeper neural networks. And the way you build a ResNet is by taking many of these residual blocks, blocks like these, and stacking them together to form a deep network</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/6.png" alt=""><br>So, let’s look at this network. This is not the residual network, this is called as <strong>a plain networ</strong>k. This is the terminology of the ResNet paper. <strong>To turn this into a ResNet, what you do is you add all those skip connections although those short like a connections like so. So every two layers ends up with that additional change that we saw on the previous slide to turn each of these into residual block. So this picture shows five residual blocks stacked together, and this is a residual network</strong>. And it turns out that if you use your standard optimization algorithm such as a gradient descent or one of the fancier optimization algorithms to the train or plain network. So without all the extra residual, without all the extra short cuts or skip connections I just drew in. Empirically, you find that as you increase the number of layers, the training error will tend to decrease after a while but then they’ll tend to go back up. And in theory as you make a neural network deeper, it should only do better and better on the training set. Right. So, the theory, in theory, having a deeper network should only help. But in practice or in reality, having a plain network, so no ResNet, having a plain network that is very deep means that all your optimization algorithm just has a much harder time training. And so, <strong>in reality, your training error gets worse if you pick a network that’s too deep. But what happens with ResNet is that even as the number of layers gets deeper, you can have the performance of the training error kind of keep on going down. Even if we train a network with over a hundred layers. And then now some people experimenting with networks of over a thousand layers although I don’t see that it used much in practice yet</strong>. But by taking these activations be it X of these intermediate activations and allowing it to go much deeper in the neural network, <strong>this really helps with the vanishing and exploding gradient problems and allows you to train much deeper neural networks without really appreciable loss in performance, and maybe at some point, this will plateau, this will flatten out, and it doesn’t help that much deeper and deeper networks. But ResNet is not even effective at helping train very deep networks</strong>.</p><p>So you’ve now gotten an overview of how ResNets work. And in fact, in this week’s programming exercise, you get to implement these ideas and see it work for yourself. But next, I want to share with you better intuition or even more intuition about why ResNets work so well, let’s go on to the next.</p><h3 id="04-why-resnets-work"><a href="#04-why-resnets-work" class="headerlink" title="04_why-resnets-work"></a>04_why-resnets-work</h3><p>So, why do ResNets work so well? Let’s go through one example that illustrates why ResNets work so well, at least in the sense of how you can make them deeper and deeper without really hurting your ability to at least get them to do well on the training set. And hopefully as you’ve understood from the third course in this sequence, doing well on the training set is usually a prerequisite to doing well on your hold up or on your depth or on your test sets. So, being able to at least train ResNet to do well on the training set is a good first step toward that. Let’s look at an example.</p><p>What we saw on the last video was that if you make a network deeper, it can hurt your ability to train the network to do well on the training set. And that’s why sometimes you don’t want a network that is too deep. But this is not true or at least is much less true when you training a ResNet. So let’s go through an example.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/7.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say you have X feeding in to some big neural network and just outputs some activation a[l]. Let’s say for this example that you are going to modify the neural network to make it a little bit deeper. So, use the same big NN, and this output’s a[l], and we’re going to add a couple extra layers to this network so let’s add one layer there and another layer there. And just for output a[l+2]. Only let’s make this a ResNet block, a residual block with that extra short cut. And for the sake our argument, let’s say throughout this network we’re using the value activation functions. So, all the activations are going to be greater than or equal to zero, with the possible exception of the input X. Right. Because the value activation output’s numbers that are either zero or positive. Now, let’s look at what’s a[l+2] will be. To copy the expression from the previous video, a[l+2] will be value apply to z[l+2], and then plus a[l] where is this addition of a[l] comes from the short circle from the skip connection that we just added. And if we expand this out, this is equal to g of w[l+2], times a of [l+1], plus b[l+2]. So that’s z[l+2] is equal to that, plus a[l]. Now notice something, if you are using L two regularisation away to K, that will tend to shrink the value of w[l+2]. If you are applying way to K to B that will also shrink this although I guess in practice sometimes you do and sometimes you don’t apply way to K to B, but W is really the key term to pay attention to here. And if w[l+2] is equal to zero. And let’s say for the sake of argument that B is also equal to zero, then these terms go away because they’re equal to zero, and then g of a[l], this is just equal to a[l] because we assumed we’re using the value activation function. And so all of the activations are all negative and so, g of a[l] is the value applied to a non-negative quantity, so you just get back, a[l]. So, what this shows is that the identity function is easy for residual block to learn. And it’s easy to get a[l+2] equals to a[l] because of this skip connection. And what that means is that adding these two layers in your neural network, it doesn’t really hurt your neural network’s ability to do as well as this simpler network without these two extra layers, because it’s quite easy for it to learn the identity function to just copy a[l] to a[l+2] using despite the addition of these two layers. And this is why adding two extra layers, adding this residual block to somewhere in the middle or the end of this big neural network it doesn’t hurt performance. But of course our goal is to not just not hurt performance, is to help performance and so you can imagine that if all of these heading units if they actually learned something useful then maybe you can do even better than learning the identity function. And what goes wrong in very deep plain nets in very deep network without this residual of the skip connections is that when you make the network deeper and deeper, it’s actually very difficult for it to choose parameters that learn even the identity function which is why a lot of layers end up making your result worse rather than making your result better. And I think the main reason the residual network works is that it’s so easy for these extra layers to learn the identity function that you’re kind of guaranteed that it doesn’t hurt performance and then a lot the time you maybe get lucky and then even helps performance. At least is easier to go from a decent baseline of not hurting performance and then great in decent can only improve the solution from there.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/8.png" alt=""><br>So, <strong>one more detail in the residual network that’s worth discussing which is through this edition here, we’re assuming that z[l+2] and a[l] have the same dimension. And so what you see in ResNet is a lot of use of same convolutions so that the dimension of this is equal to the dimension I guess of this layer or the outputs layer</strong>. So that we can actually do this short circle connection, because the same convolution preserve dimensions, and so makes that easier for you to carry out this short circle and then carry out this addition of two equal dimension vectors.** In case the input and output have different dimensions** so for example, if this is a 128 dimensional and Z or therefore, a[l] is 256 dimensional as an example. <strong>What you would do is add an extra matrix and then call that Ws over here</strong>, and Ws in this example would be a[l] 256 by 128 dimensional matrix. So then Ws times a[l] becomes 256 dimensional and this addition is now between two 256 dimensional vectors and <strong>there are few things you could do with Ws, it could be a matrix of parameters we learned, it could be a fixed matrix that just implements zero paddings that takes a[l] and then zero pads it to be 256 dimensional and either of those versions I guess could work</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/9.png" alt=""><br>So finally, let’s take a look at ResNets on images. So these are images I got from the paper by Harlow. This is an example of a plain network and in which you input an image and then have a number of conv layers until eventually you have a softmax output at the end. <strong>To turn this into a ResNet, you add those extra skip connections. And I’ll just mention a few details, there are a lot of three by three convolutions here and most of these are three by three same convolutions and that’s why you’re adding equal dimension feature vectors</strong>. So rather than a fully connected layer, these are actually convolutional layers but because the same convolutions, the dimensions are preserved and so the z[l+2] plus a[l] by addition makes sense. And similar to what you’ve seen in a lot of NetRes before, you have a bunch of convolutional layers <strong>and then there are occasionally pooling layers as well or pooling a pooling likely is. And whenever one of those things happen, then you need to make an adjustment to the dimension which we saw on the previous slide. You can do of the matrix Ws</strong>, and then as is common in these networks, you have Conv Conv Conv pool Conv Conv Conv pool Conv Conv Conv pool, and then at the end you now have a fully connected layer that then makes a prediction using a softmax.</p><p>So that’s it for ResNet. Next, there’s a very interesting idea behind using neural networks with one by one filters, one by one convolutions. So, one could use a one by one convolution. Let’s take a look at the next video.</p><h3 id="05-networks-in-networks-and-1x1-convolutions"><a href="#05-networks-in-networks-and-1x1-convolutions" class="headerlink" title="05_networks-in-networks-and-1x1-convolutions"></a>05_networks-in-networks-and-1x1-convolutions</h3><p>In terms of designing content architectures, one of the ideas that really helps is using a one by one convolution. Now, you might be wondering, what does a one by one convolution do? Isn’t that just multiplying by numbers? That seems like a funny thing to do. Turns out it’s not quite like that. Let’s take a look.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/10.png" alt=""><br>So you’ll see one by one filter, we’ll put in number two there, and if you take the six by six image, six by six by one and convolve it with this one by one by one filter, you end up just taking the image and multiplying it by two. So, one, two, three ends up being two, four, six, and so on. And so, a convolution by a one by one filter, doesn’t seem particularly useful. You just multiply it by some number. But that’s the case of six by six by one channel images. If you have a 6 by 6 by 32 instead of by 1, then a convolution with a 1 by 1 filter can do something that makes much more sense. And in particular, what a one by one convolution will do is it will look at each of the 36 different positions here, and <strong>it will take the element-wise product between 32 numbers on the left and 32 numbers in the filter. And then apply a ReLU non-linearity to it after that</strong>. So, to look at one of the 36 positions, maybe one slice through this value, you take these 36 numbers multiply it by 1 slice through the volume like that, and you end up with a single real number which then gets plotted in one of the outputs like that. And in fact, one way to think about the 32 numbers you have in this 1 by 1 by 32 filters is that, it’s as if you have neuron that is taking as input, 32 numbers multiplying each of these 32 numbers in one slice of the same position heightened with by these 32 different channels, multiplying them by 32 weights and then applying a ReLU non-linearity to it and then outputting the corresponding thing over there. And more generally, if you have not just one filter, but if you have multiple filters, then it’s as if you have not just one unit, but multiple units, taken as input all the numbers in one slice, and then building them up into an output of six by six by number of filters. <strong>So one way to think about the one by one convolution is that, it is basically having a fully connected neuron network, that applies to each of the 36 different positions</strong>. And what does fully connected neural network does? Is it puts 32 numbers and outputs number of filters outputs. So I guess the point on notation, this is really a nc(l+1), if that’s the next layer. And by doing this at each of the 36 positions, each of the six by six positions, you end up with an output that is six by six by the number of filters. And this can carry out a pretty non-trivial computation on your input volume. <strong>And this idea is often called a one by one convolution but it’s sometimes also called Network in Network, and is described in this paper, by Min Lin, Qiang Chen, and Schuicheng Yan. And even though the details of the architecture in this paper aren’t used widely, this idea of a one by one convolution or this sometimes called Network in Network idea has been very influential, has influenced many other neural network architectures including the inception network</strong> which we’ll see in the next video.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/11.png" alt=""><br>But to give you an example of where one by one convolution is useful, here’s something you could do with it. Let’s say you have a 28 by 28 by 192 volume. If you want to shrink the height and width, you can use a pulling layer. So we know how to do that. But one of a number of channels has gotten too big and we want to shrink that. How do you shrink it to a 28 by 28 by 32 dimensional volume? Well, what you can do is <strong>use 32 filters that are one by one. And technically, each filter would be of dimension 1 by 1 by 192, because the number of channels in your filter has to match the number of channels in your input volume, but you use 32 filters and the output of this process will be a 28 by 28 by 32 volume. So this is a way to let you shrink nc as well, whereas pooling layers, I used just to shrink nH and nW, the height and width these volumes</strong>. And we’ll see later how this idea of <strong>one by one convolutions allows you to shrink the number of channels and therefore, save on computation in some networks</strong>.</p><p><strong>But of course, if you want to keep the number of channels at 192, that’s fine too. And the effect of the one by one convolution is it just adds non-linearity.</strong> It allows you to learn the more complex function of your network by adding another layer that inputs 28 by 28 by 192 and outputs 28 by 28 by 192. So, that’s how a one by one convolutional layer is actually doing something pretty non-trivial and adds non-linearity to your neural network and allow you to decrease or keep the same or if you want, increase the number of channels in your volumes. Next, you’ll see that this is actually very useful for building the inception network. Let’s go on to that in the next video.</p><p>So, you’ve now seen how a one by one convolution operation is actually doing a pretty non-trivial operation and it allows you to shrink the number of channels in your volumes or keep it the same or even increase it if you want. In the next video, you see that this can be used to help build up to the inception network. Let’s go into the-</p><h3 id="06-inception-network-motivation"><a href="#06-inception-network-motivation" class="headerlink" title="06_inception-network-motivation"></a>06_inception-network-motivation</h3><p>When designing a layer for a ConvNet, you might have to pick, do you want a 1 by 3 filter, or 3 by 3, or 5 by 5, or do you want a pooling layer? What the inception network does is it says, why should you do them all? And this makes the network architecture more complicated, but it also works remarkably well. Let’s see how this works.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/12.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say for the sake of example that you have inputted a 28 by 28 by 192 dimensional volume. So what the inception network or what an inception layer says is, instead choosing what filter size you want in a Conv layer, or even do you want a convolutional layer or a pooling layer? Let’s do them all. So what if you can use a 1 by 1 convolution, and that will output a 28 by 28 by something. Let’s say 28 by 28 by 64 output, and you just have a volume there. But maybe you also want to try a 3 by 3 and that might output a 20 by 20 by 128. And then what you do is just stack up this second volume next to the first volume. And to make the dimensions match up, let’s make this a same convolution. So the output dimension is still 28 by 28, same as the input dimension in terms of height and width. But 28 by 28 by in this example 128. And maybe you might say well I want to hedge my bets. Maybe a 5 by 5 filter works better. So let’s do that too and have that output a 28 by 28 by 32. And again you use the same convolution to keep the dimensions the same. And maybe you don’t want to convolutional layer. Let’s apply pooling, and that has some other output and let’s stack that up as well. And here pooling outputs 28 by 28 by 32. Now in order to make all the dimensions match, you actually need to use padding for max pooling. So this is an unusual formal pooling because if you want the input to have a higher than 28 by 28 and have the output, you’ll match the dimension everything else also by 28 by 28, then you need to use the same padding as well as a stride of one for pooling. So this detail might seem a bit funny to you now, but let’s keep going. And we’ll make this all work later. But with a inception module like this, you can input some volume and output. In this case I guess if you add up all these numbers, 32 plus 32 plus 128 plus 64, that’s equal to 256. So you will have one inception module input 28 by 28 by 129, and output 28 by 28 by 256. And this is the heart of the inception network which is due to Christian Szegedy, Wei Liu, Yangqing Jia, Pierre Sermanet, Scott Reed, Dragomir Anguelov, Dumitru Erhan, Vincent Vanhoucke and Andrew Rabinovich. <strong>And the basic idea is that instead of you needing to pick one of these filter sizes or pooling you want and committing to that, you can do them all and just concatenate all the outputs, and let the network learn whatever parameters it wants to use, whatever the combinations of these filter sizes it wants</strong>. Now <strong>it turns out that there is a problem with the inception layer as we’ve described it here, which is computational cost</strong>. On the next slide, let’s figure out what’s the computational cost of this 5 by 5 filter resulting in this block over here.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/13.png" alt=""><br>So just focusing on the 5 by 5 pot on the previous slide, we had as input a 28 by 28 by 192 block, and you implement a 5 by 5 same convolution of 32 filters to output 28 by 28 by 32. On the previous slide I had drawn this as a thin purple slide. So I’m just going draw this as a more normal looking blue block here. So let’s look at the computational costs of outputting this 20 by 20 by 32. So you have 32 filters because the outputs has 32 channels, and each filter is going to be 5 by 5 by 192. And so the output size is 20 by 20 by 32, and so you need to compute 28 by 28 by 32 numbers. And for each of them you need to do these many multiplications, right? 5 by 5 by 192. So the total number of multiplies you need is the number of multiplies you need to compute each of the output values times the number of output values you need to compute. And if you multiply all of these numbers, this is equal to 120 million. And so, while you can do 120 million multiplies on the modern computer, this is still a pretty expensive operation. On the next slide you see how using the idea of 1 by 1 convolutions, which you learnt about in the previous video, you’ll be able to reduce the computational costs by about a factor of 10. To go from about 120 million multiplies to about one tenth of that. So please remember the number 120 so you can compare it with what you see on the next slide, 120 million.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/14.png" alt=""><br>Here is an alternative architecture for inputting 28 by 28 by 192, and outputting 28 by 28 by 32, which is following. You are going to input the volume, use a 1 by 1 convolution to reduce the volume to 16 channels instead of 192 channels, and then on this much smaller volume, run your 5 by 5 convolution to give you your final output. So notice the input and output dimensions are still the same. You input 28 by 28 by 192 and output 28 by 28 by 32, same as the previous slide. But what we’ve done is we’re taking this huge volume we had on the left, and we shrunk it to this much smaller intermediate volume, which only has 16 instead of 192 channels. Sometimes this is called <strong>a bottleneck layer</strong>, right? I guess because a bottleneck is usually the smallest part of something, right? So I guess if you have a glass bottle that looks like this, then you know this is I guess where the cork goes. And then the bottleneck is the smallest part of this bottle. So in the same way, the bottleneck layer is the smallest part of this network. We shrink the representation before increasing the size again. Now let’s look at the computational costs involved. To apply this 1 by 1 convolution, we have 16 filters. Each of the filters is going to be of dimension 1 by 1 by 192, this 192 matches that 192. And so the cost of computing this 28 by 28 by 16 volumes is going to be well, you need these many outputs, and for each of them you need to do 192 multiplications. I could have written 1 times 1 times 192, right? Which is this. And if you multiply this out, this is 2.4 million, it’s about 2.4 million. How about the second? So that’s the cost of this first convolutional layer. The cost of this second convolutional layer would be that well, you have these many outputs. So 28 by 28 by 32. And then for each of the outputs you have to apply a 5 by 5 by 16 dimensional filter. And so by 5 by 5 by 16. And you multiply that out is equals to 10.0. And so the total number of multiplications you need to do is the sum of those which is 12.4 million multiplications. And you compare this with what we had on the previous slide, you reduce the computational cost from about 120 million multiplies, down to about one tenth of that, to 12.4 million multiplications. And the number of additions you need to do is about very similar to the number of multiplications you need to do. So that’s why I’m just counting the number of multiplications.</p><p><strong>So to summarize, if you are building a layer of a neural network and you don’t want to have to decide, do you want a 1 by 1, or 3 by 3, or 5 by 5, or pooling layer, the inception module let’s you say let’s do them all, and let’s concatenate the results. And then we run to the problem of computational cost</strong>. And what you saw here was how using a 1 by 1 convolution, you can create this bottleneck layer thereby reducing the computational cost significantly. Now you might be wondering, does shrinking down the representation size so dramatically, does it hurt the performance of your neural network? <strong>It turns out that so long as you implement this bottleneck layer so that within region, you can shrink down the representation size significantly, and it doesn’t seem to hurt the performance, but saves you a lot of computation. So these are the key ideas of the inception module</strong>. Let’s put them together and in the next video show you what the full inception network looks like.</p><h3 id="07-inception-network"><a href="#07-inception-network" class="headerlink" title="07_inception-network"></a>07_inception-network</h3><p>In a previous video, you’ve already seen all the basic building blocks of the Inception network. In this video, let’s see how you can put these building blocks together to build your own Inception network.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/15.png" alt=""><br>So the inception module takes as input the activation or the output from some previous layer. So let’s say for the sake of argument this is 28 by 28 by 192, same as our previous video. The example we worked through in depth was the 1 by 1 followed by 5 by 5. There, so maybe the 1 by 1 has 16 channels and then the 5 by 5 will output a 28 by 28 by, let’s say, 32 channels. And this is the example we worked through on the last slide of the previous video. Then to save computation on your 3 by 3 convolution you can also do the same here. And then the 3 by 3 outputs, 28 by 28 by 1 by 28. And then maybe you want to consider a 1 by 1 convolution as well. There’s no need to do a 1 by 1 conv followed by another 1 by 1 conv so there’s just one step here and let’s say these outputs 28 by 28 by 64. And then finally is the pulling layer. So here I’m going to do something funny. In order to really concatenate all of these outputs at the end we are going to use the same type of padding for pooling. So that the output height and width is still 28 by 28. So we can concatenate it with these other outputs. But notice that if you do max-pooling, even with same padding, 3 by 3 filter is tried at 1. The output here will be 28 by 28, By 192. It will have the same number of channels and the same depth as the input that we had here. So, this seems like is has a lot of channels. So what we’re going to do is actually add one more 1 by 1 conv layer to then to what we saw in the one by one convilational video, to strengthen the number of channels. So it gets us down to 28 by 28 by let’s say, 32. And the way you do that, is to use 32 filters, of dimension 1 by 1 by 192. So that’s why the output dimension has a number of channels shrunk down to 32. So then we don’t end up with the pulling layer taking up all the channels in the final output. And finally you take all of these blocks and you do channel concatenation. Just concatenate across this 64 plus 128 plus 32 plus 32 and this if you add it up this gives you a 28 by 28 by 256 dimension output. Concat is just this concatenating the blocks that we saw in the previous video. So this is one inception module, and what the inception network does, is, more or less, put a lot of these modules together.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/18.png" alt=""><br>Here’s a picture of the inception network, taken from the paper by Szegedy et al And you notice <strong>a lot of repeated blocks in this</strong>. Maybe this picture looks really complicated. But if you look at one of the blocks there, that block is basically the inception module that you saw on the previous slide. And subject to little details I won’t discuss, this is another inception block. This is another inception block. There’s some extra max pooling layers here to change the dimension of the heightened width. But that’s another inception block. And then there’s another max put here to change the height and width but basically there’s another inception block. But the inception network is just a lot of these blocks that you’ve learned about repeated to different positions of the network. But so you understand the inception block from the previous slide, then you understand the inception network.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/16.png" alt=""><br>It turns out that there’s <strong>one last detail to the inception network if we read the optional research paper. Which is that there are these additional side-branches that I just added.</strong> So what do they do? <strong>Well, the last few layers of the network is a fully connected layer followed by a softmax layer to try to make a prediction. What these side branches do is it takes some hidden layer and it tries to use that to make a prediction. So this is actually a softmax output and so is that. And this other side branch, again it is a hidden layer passes through a few layers like a few connected layers. And then has the softmax try to predict what’s the output label</strong>. And you should think of this as maybe just another detail of the inception that’s worked. <strong>But what is does is it helps to ensure that the features computed. Even in the heading units, even at intermediate layers. That they’re not too bad for protecting the output cause of a image. And this appears to have a regularizing effect on the inception network and helps prevent this network from overfitting</strong>. And by the way, this particular Inception network was developed by authors at Google. Who called it GoogleNet, spelled like that, to pay homage to the network. That you learned about in an earlier video as well. So I think it’s actually really nice that the Deep Learning Community is so collaborative. And that there’s such strong healthy respect for each other’s’ work in the Deep Learning Learning community.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/17.png" alt=""><br><strong>Finally here’s one fun fact. Where does the name inception network come from</strong>? The inception paper actually cites this meme for we need to go deeper. And this URL is an actual reference in the inception paper, which links to this image. And if you’ve seen the movie titled The Inception, maybe this meme will make sense to you. But the authors actually cite this meme as motivation for needing to build deeper new networks. And that’s how they came up with the inception architecture. So I guess it’s not often that research papers get to cite Internet memes in their citations. But in this case, I guess it worked out quite well.</p><p><strong>So to summarize, if you understand the inception module, then you understand the inception network. Which is largely the inception module repeated a bunch of times throughout the network. Since the development of the original inception module, the author and others have built on it and come up with other versions as well</strong>. So there are research papers on newer versions of the inception algorithm. And you sometimes see people use some of these later versions as well in their work, like inception v2, inception v3, inception v4. There’s also an inception version. This combined with the resonant idea of having skipped connections, and that sometimes works even better. <strong>But all of these variations are built on the basic idea that you learned about this in the previous video of coming up with the inception module and then stacking up a bunch of them together</strong>. And with these videos you should be able to read and understand, I think, the inception paper, as well as maybe some of the papers describing the later derivation as well. <strong>So that’s it, you’ve gone through quite a lot of specialized neural network architectures. In the next video, I want to start showing you some more practical advice on how you actually use these algorithms to build your own computer vision system</strong>. Let’s go on to the next video.</p><h2 id="02-practical-advices-for-using-convnets"><a href="#02-practical-advices-for-using-convnets" class="headerlink" title="02_practical-advices-for-using-convnets"></a>02_practical-advices-for-using-convnets</h2><h3 id="01-using-open-source-implementation"><a href="#01-using-open-source-implementation" class="headerlink" title="01_using-open-source-implementation"></a>01_using-open-source-implementation</h3><p>You’ve now learned about several highly effective neural network and ConvNet architectures. What I want to do in the next few videos is share with you some practical advice on how to use them, <strong>first starting with using open source implementations. It turns out that a lot of these neural networks are difficult or finicky to replicate because a lot of details about tuning of the hyperparameters such as learning decay and other things that make some difference to the performance. And so I’ve found that it’s sometimes difficult even for, say, a higher deep loving PhD students, even at the top universities to replicate someone else’s polished work just from reading their paper</strong>. Fortunately, a lot of deep learning researchers routinely open source their work on the Internet, such as on GitHub. And as you do work yourself, I certainly encourage you to consider contributing back your code to the open source community. <strong>But if you see a research paper whose results you would like to build on top of, one thing you should consider doing, one thing I do quite often it’s just look online for an open source implementation. Because if you can get the author’s implementation, you can usually get going much faster than if you would try to reimplement it from scratch. Although sometimes reimplementing from scratch could be a good exercise to do as well</strong>. If you’re already familiar with how to use GitHub, this video might be less necessary or less important for you. But if you aren’t used to downloading open-source code from GitHub, let me quickly show you how easy it is.</p><p><img src="I:/imgs/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/02_deep-convolutional-models-case-studies/1.gif" alt=""><br>Let’s say you’re excited about residual networks, and you want to use it. So let’s search for residence on GitHub. And so you actually see a lot of different implementations of residence on GitHub. And I’m just going to go to the first URL here. And this is a GitHub repo that implements residence. Along with the GitHub webpages if you scroll down we’ll have some text describing the work or the particular implementation. On this particular repo, this particular GitHub repository was actually by the original authors of the ResNet paper. And this code, this license under an MIT license, you can click through to take a look at the implications of this license. The MIT License is one of the more permissive or one of the more open open-source licenses. So I’m going to go ahead and download the code, and to do that, click on this link. This gives you the URL that you can use to download the code. I’m going to click on this button over here to copy the URL to my clipboard and then go over here. Then all you have to do is type git clone and then Ctrl+V for the URL and hit Enter. And so in a couples of seconds it has download, has cloned this repository to my local hard disk. So let’s go into the directory and let’s take a look. I’m more used in Mac than Windows, but I guess let’s see, let’s go to prototxt and I think this is where it has the files specifying the network. So let’s take a look at this file, because this is a very long file that specifies the detail configurations of the ResNet with a 101 layers, all right? And it looks like from what I remember seeing from this webpage, this particular implementation uses the Cafe framework. But if you wanted implementation of this code using some other programming framework, you might be able to find it as well.</p><p>So if you’re developing a computer vision application, a very common workflow would be to pick an architecture that you like, maybe one of the ones you learned about in this course. Or maybe one that you heard about from a friend or from some literature. And look for an open source implementation and download it from GitHub to start building from there. <strong>One of the advantages of doing so also is that sometimes these networks take a long time to train, and someone else might have used multiple GPUs and a very large dataset to pretrain some of these networks. And that allows you to do transfer learning using these networks which we’ll discuss in the next video as well</strong>. Of course if you’re computer vision researcher implementing these things from scratch, then your workflow will be different. And if you do that, then do contribute your work back to the open source community. But <strong>because so many vision researchers have done so much work implementing these architectures, I found that often starting with open-source implementations is a better way, or certainly a faster way to get started on a new project</strong>.</p><h3 id="02-transfer-learning"><a href="#02-transfer-learning" class="headerlink" title="02_transfer-learning"></a>02_transfer-learning</h3><p>I<strong>f you’re building a computer vision application rather than training the ways from scratch, from random initialization, you often make much faster progress if you download weights that someone else has already trained on the network architecture and use that as pre-training and transfer that to a new task that you might be interested in</strong>. The computer vision research community has been pretty good at posting lots of data sets on the Internet so if you hear of things like Image Net, or MS COCO, or Pascal types of data sets, these are the names of different data sets that people have post online and a lot of computer researchers have trained their algorithms on. <strong>Sometimes these training takes several weeks and might take many GP use and the fact that someone else has done this and gone through the painful high-performance search process, means that you can often download open source weights that took someone else many weeks or months to figure out and use that as a very good initialization for your own neural network. And use transfer learning to sort of transfer knowledge from some of these very large public data sets to your own problem</strong>. Let’s take a deeper look at how to do this.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/19.png" alt=""><br>Let’s start with the example, <strong>let’s say you’re building a cat detector to recognize your own pet cat. According to the internet, Tigger is a common cat name and Misty is another common cat name. Let’s say your cats are called Tiger and Misty and there’s also neither</strong>. You have a classification problem with three clauses. Is this picture Tigger, or is it Misty, or is it neither. <strong>And in all the case of both of you cats appearing in the picture. Now, you probably don’t have a lot of pictures of Tigger or Misty so your training set will be small. What can you do? I recommend you go online and download some open source implementation of a neural network and download not just the code but also the weights</strong>. There are a lot of networks you can download that have been trained on for example, the Init Net data sets which has a thousand different clauses so the network might have a softmax unit that outputs one of a thousand possible clauses. <strong>What you can do is then get rid of the softmax layer and create your own softmax unit that outputs Tigger or Misty or neither. In terms of the network, I’d encourage you to think of all of these layers as frozen so you freeze the parameters in all of these layers of the network and you would then just train the parameters associated with your softmax layer. Which is the softmax layer with three possible outputs, Tigger, Misty or neither. By using someone else’s free trade weights, you might probably get pretty good performance on this even with a small data set</strong>.</p><p>Fortunately, a lot of people learning frameworks support this mode of operation and in fact, depending on the framework it might have things like <strong>trainable parameter</strong> equals zero, you might set that for some of these early layers. In others they just say, don’t train those ways or sometimes you have a parameter like <strong>freeze</strong> equals one and <strong>these are different ways and different deep learning program frameworks that let you specify whether or not to train the ways associated with particular layer</strong>. In this case, you will train only the softmax layers ways but freeze all of the earlier layers ways.</p><p>One other neat trick that may help for some implementations is that because all of these early leads are frozen, there are some fixed function that doesn’t change because you’re not changing it, you not training it that takes this input image acts and maps it to some set of activations in that layer. <strong>One of the trick that could speed up training is we just pre-compute that layer, the features of re-activations from that layer and just save them to disk. What you’re doing is using this fixed function, in this first part of the neural network, to take this input any image X and compute some feature vector for it and then you’re training a shallow softmax model from this feature vector to make a prediction. One step that could help your computation as you just pre-compute that layers activation, for all the examples in training sets and save them to disk and then just train the softmax clause right on top of that. The advantage of the safety disk or the pre-compute method or the safety disk is that you don’t need to recompute those activations everytime you take a epoch or take a post through a training set</strong>. This is what you do if you have a pretty small training set for your task.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/20.png" alt=""><br><strong>What of a larger training set</strong>? One rule of thumb is if you have a larger label data set so maybe you just have a ton of pictures of Tigger, Misty as well as I guess pictures neither of them, one thing you could do is <strong>then freeze fewer layers</strong>. Maybe you freeze just these layers and then train these later layers. Although if the output layer has different clauses then you need to have your own output unit any way Tigger, Misty or neither. There are a couple of ways to do this. You could take the last few layers ways and just use that as initialization and do gradient descent from there or you can also blow away these last few layers and just use your own new hidden units and in your own final softmax outputs. Either of these matters could be worth trying. But maybe one pattern is if you have more data, the number of layers you’ve freeze could be smaller and then the number of layers you train on top could be greater. And the idea is that if you pick a data set and maybe have enough data not just to train a single softmax unit but to train some other size neural network that comprises the last few layers of this final network that you end up using.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/21.png" alt=""><br><strong>Finally, if you have a lot of data, one thing you might do is take this open source network and weights and use the whole thing just as initialization and train the whole network</strong>. Although again if this was a thousand of softmax and you have just three outputs, you need your own softmax output. The output of labels you care about. But the more label data you have for your task or the more pictures you have of Tigger, Misty and neither, the more layers you could train and in the extreme case, you could use the ways you download just as initialization so they would replace random initialization and then could do gradient descent, training updating all the ways and all the layers of the network.</p><p>So that’s transfer learning for the training of ConvNets. In practice, because the open data sets on the internet are so big and the ways you can download that someone else has spent weeks training has learned from so much data, you find that for a lot of computer vision applications, you just do much better if you download someone else’s open source ways and use that as initialization for your problem. <strong>In all the different disciplines, in all the different applications of deep learning, I think that computer vision is one where transfer learning is something that you should almost always do unless, you have an exceptionally large data set to train everything else from scratch yourself. But transfer learning is just very worth seriously considering unless you have an exceptionally large data set and a very large computation budget to train everything from scratch by yourself</strong>.</p><h3 id="03-data-augmentation"><a href="#03-data-augmentation" class="headerlink" title="03_data-augmentation"></a>03_data-augmentation</h3><p>Most computer vision task could use more data. And so data augmentation is one of the techniques that is often used to improve the performance of computer vision systems. I think that computer vision is a pretty complicated task. You have to input this image, all these pixels and then figure out what is in this picture. And it seems like you need to learn the decently complicated function to do that. And in practice, there almost all competing visions task having more data will help. This is unlike some other domains where sometimes you can get enough data, they don’t feel as much pressure to get even more data. But I think today, this data computer vision is that, for the majority of computer vision problems, we feel like we just can’t get enough data. And this is not true for all applications of machine learning, but it does feel like it’s true for computer vision. So, what that means is that when you’re training in computer vision model, often data augmentation will help. And this is true whether you’re using transfer learning or using someone else’s pre-trained ways to start, or whether you’re trying to train something yourself from scratch. Let’s take a look at the common data augmentation that is in computer vision.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/22.png" alt=""><br>Perhaps the simplest data augmentation method is <strong>mirroring</strong> on the vertical axis, where if you have this example in your training set, you flip it horizontally to get that image on the right. And for most computer vision task, if the left picture is a cat then mirroring it is though a cat. And if the mirroring operation preserves whatever you’re trying to recognize in the picture, this would be a good data augmentation technique to use. Another commonly used technique is <strong>random cropping</strong>. So given this dataset, let’s pick a few random crops. So you might pick that, and take that crop or you might take that, to that crop, take this, take that crop and so this gives you different examples to feed in your training sample, sort of different random crops of your datasets. So random cropping isn’t a perfect data augmentation. What if you randomly end up taking that crop which will look much like a cat but in practice and worthwhile so long as your random crops are reasonably large subsets of the actual image. <strong>So, mirroring and random cropping are frequently used and in theory, you could also use things like <em>rotation</em>, <em>shearing</em> of the image, so that’s if you do this to the image, distort it that way, introduce various forms of local warping and so on. And there’s really no harm with trying all of these things as well, although in practice they seem to be used a bit less, or perhaps because of their complexity</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/23.png" alt=""><br>The second type of data augmentation that is commonly used is <strong>color shifting</strong>. So, given a picture like this, let’s say you add to the R, G and B channels different distortions. In this example, we are adding to the red and blue channels and subtracting from the green channel. So, red and blue make purple. So, this makes the whole image a bit more purpley and that creates a distorted image for training set. For illustration purposes, I’m making somewhat dramatic changes to the colors and practice, you draw R, G and B from some distribution that could be quite small as well. But what you do is take different values of R, G, and B and use them to distort the color channels. So, in the second example, we are making a less red, and more green and more blue, so that turns our image a bit more yellowish. And here, we are making it much more blue, just a tiny little bit longer. But in practice, the values R, G and B, are drawn from some probability distribution. And the motivation for this is that if maybe the sunlight was a bit yellow or maybe the in-goal illumination was a bit more yellow, that could easily change the color of an image, but the identity of the cat or the identity of the content, the label y, just still stay the same. And so introducing these color distortions or by doing color shifting, this makes your learning algorithm more robust to changes in the colors of your images. Just a comment for the advanced learners in this course, that is okay if you don’t understand what I’m about to say when using red. There are different ways to sample R, G, and B. One of the ways to implement color distortion uses an algorithm called PCA. This is called Principles Component Analysis, which I talked about in the ml-class.org Machine Learning Course on Coursera. But <strong>the details of this are actually given in the AlexNet paper, and sometimes called PCA Color Augmentation. But the rough idea at the time PCA Color Augmentation is for example, if your image is mainly purple, if it mainly has red and blue tints, and very little green, then PCA Color Augmentation, will add and subtract a lot to red and blue, were relatively little green, so kind of keeps the overall color of the tint the same. If you didn’t understand any of this, don’t worry about it. But if you can search online for that, you can and if you want to read about the details of it in the AlexNet paper, and you can also find some open source implementations of the PCA Color Augmentation, and just use that</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/24.png" alt=""><br>So, you might have your training data stored in a hard disk and uses symbol, this round bucket symbol to represent your hard disk. And if you have a small training set, you can do almost anything and you’ll be okay. But the very last training set and this is how people will often implement it, which is you might have a CPU thread that is constantly loading images of your hard disk. So, you have this stream of images coming in from your hard disk. And what you can do is use maybe a CPU thread to implement the distortions, yet the random cropping, or the color shifting, or the mirroring, but for each image, you might then end up with some distorted version of it. So, let’s see this image, I’m going to mirror it and if you also implement colors distortion and so on. And if this image ends up being color shifted, so you end up with some different colored cat. And so your CPU thread is constantly loading data as well as implementing whether the distortions are needed to form a batch or really many batches of data. And this data is then constantly passed to some other thread or some other process for implementing training and this could be done on the CPU or really increasingly on the GPU if you have a large neural network to train. <strong>And so, a pretty common way of implementing data augmentation is to really have one thread, almost multiple threads, that is responsible for loading the data and implementing distortions, and then passing that to some other thread or some other process that then does the training. And often, this and this, can run in parallel</strong>.</p><p>So, that’s it for data augmentation. And similar to other parts of training a deep neural network, the data augmentation process also has a few hyperparameters such as how much color shifting do you implement and exactly what parameters you use for random cropping? So, similar to elsewhere in computer vision, a good place to get started might be to use someone else’s open source implementation for how they use data augmentation. But of course, if you want to capture more in variances, then you think someone else’s open source implementation isn’t, it might be reasonable also to use hyperparameters yourself. So with that, I hope that you’re going to use data augmentation, to get your computer vision applications to work better.</p><h3 id="04-state-of-computer-vision"><a href="#04-state-of-computer-vision" class="headerlink" title="04_state-of-computer-vision"></a>04_state-of-computer-vision</h3><p>Deep learning has been successfully applied to computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, online advertising, logistics, many, many, many problems. There are a few things that are unique about the application of deep learning to computer vision, about the status of computer vision. In this video, I will share with you some of my observations about deep learning for computer vision and I hope that that will help you better navigate the literature, and the set of ideas out there, and how you build these systems yourself for computer vision.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/25.png" alt=""><br>So, you can think of most machine learning problems as falling somewhere on the spectrum between where you have relatively little data to where you have lots of data. So, for example I think that today we have a decent amount of data for speech recognition and it’s relative to the complexity of the problem. And even though there are reasonably large data sets today for image recognition or image classification, because image recognition is just a complicated problem to look at all those pixels and figure out what it is. It feels like even though the online data sets are quite big like over a million images, feels like we still wish we had more data. And there are some problems like object detection where we have even less data. So, just as a reminder image recognition was the problem of looking at a picture and telling you is this a cattle or not. Whereas object detection is look in the picture and actually you’re putting the bounding boxes are telling you where in the picture the objects such as the car as well. And so because of the cost of getting the bounding boxes is just more expensive to label the objects and the bounding boxes. So, we tend to have less data for object detection than for image recognition. And object detection is something we’ll discuss next week. <strong>So, if you look across a broad spectrum of machine learning problems, you see on average that when you have a lot of data you tend to find people getting away with using simpler algorithms as well as less hand-engineering. So, there’s just less needing to carefully design features for the problem, but instead you can have a giant neural network, even a simpler architecture, and have a neural network. Just learn whether we want to learn we have a lot of data. Whereas, in contrast when you don’t have that much data then on average you see people engaging in more hand-engineering. And if you want to be ungenerous you can say there are more hacks. But I think when you don’t have much data then hand-engineering is actually the best way to get good performance</strong>.</p><p>So, when I look at machine learning applications <strong>I think usually we have the learning algorithm has two sources of knowledge. One source of knowledge is the labeled data</strong>, really the (x,y) pairs you use for supervised learning. <strong>And the second source of knowledge is the hand-engineering</strong>. And there are lots of ways to hand-engineer a system. It can be from carefully hand designing the features, to carefully hand designing the network architectures to maybe other components of your system. And so when you don’t have much labeled data you just have to call more on hand-engineering. And so <strong>I think computer vision is trying to learn a really complex function. And it often feels like we don’t have enough data for computer vision. Even though data sets are getting bigger and bigger, often we just don’t have as much data as we need. And this is why this data computer vision historically and even today has relied more on hand-engineering. And I think this is also why that either computer vision has developed rather complex network architectures, is because in the absence of more data the way to get good performance is to spend more time architecting, or fooling around with the network architecture</strong>. And in case you think I’m being derogatory of hand-engineering that’s not at all my intent. <strong>When you don’t have enough data hand-engineering is a very difficult, very skillful task that requires a lot of insight. And someone that is insightful with hand-engineering will get better performance, and is a great contribution to a project to do that hand-engineering when you don’t have enough data. It’s just when you have lots of data then I wouldn’t spend time hand-engineering, I would spend time building up the learning system instead</strong>. But I think historically the fear the computer vision has used very small data sets, and so historically the computer vision literature has relied on a lot of hand-engineering. <strong>And even though in the last few years the amount of data with the right computer vision task has increased dramatically, I think that that has resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of hand-engineering that’s being done. But there’s still a lot of hand-engineering of network architectures and computer vision</strong>. Which is why you see very complicated hyper frantic choices in computer vision, are more complex than you do in a lot of other disciplines. And in fact, because you usually have smaller object detection data sets than image recognition data sets, when we talk about object detection that is task like this next week. <strong>You see that the algorithms become even more complex and has even more specialized components. Fortunately, one thing that helps a lot when you have little data is transfer learning</strong>. And I would say for the example from the previous slide of the tigger, misty, neither detection problem, you have soluble data that transfer learning will help a lot. <strong>And so that’s another set of techniques that’s used a lot for when you have relatively little data</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/26.png" alt=""><br>If you look at the computer vision literature, and look at the sort of ideas out there, you also find that people are really enthusiastic. They’re really into doing well on standardized benchmark data sets and on winning competitions. And for computer vision researchers if you do well and the benchmark is easier to get the paper published. So, there’s just a lot of attention on doing well on these benchmarks. And the positive side of this is that, it helps the whole community figure out what are the most effective algorithms. But you also see in the papers people do things that allow you to do well on a benchmark, but that you wouldn’t really use in a production or a system that you deploy in an actual application. So, here are a few tips on doing well on benchmarks. These are things that I don’t myself pretty much ever use if I’m putting a system to production that is actually to serve customers.</p><p>But one is <strong>ensembling</strong>. And what that means is, <strong>after you’ve figured out what neural network you want, train several neural networks independently and average their outputs</strong>. So, initialize say 3, or 5, or 7 neural networks randomly and train up all of these neural networks, and then average their outputs. And by the way it is important to average their outputs y hats. Don’t average their weights that won’t work. Look and you say seven neural networks that have seven different predictions and average that. And this will cause you to do maybe 1% better, or 2% better. So is a little bit better on some benchmark. And this will cause you to do a little bit better. Maybe sometimes as much as 1 or 2% which really help win a competition. But because ensembling means that to test on each image, you might need to run an image through anywhere from say 3 to 15 different networks quite typical. This slows down your running time by a factor of 3 to 15, or sometimes even more. And so ensembling is one of those tips that people use doing well in benchmarks and for winning competitions. But that I think is almost never use in production to serve actual customers. I guess unless you have huge computational budget and don’t mind burning a lot more of it per customer image.</p><p>Another thing you see in papers that really helps on benchmarks, is <strong>multi-crop</strong> at test time. So, <strong>what I mean by that is you’ve seen how you can do data augmentation. And multi-crop is a form of applying data augmentation to your test image as well</strong>. So, for example let’s see a cat image and just copy it four times including two more versions. There’s a technique called the <strong>10-crop</strong>, which basically says let’s say you take this central region that crop, and run it through your crossfire. And then take that crop up the left hand corner run through a crossfire, up right hand corner shown in green, lower left shown in yellow, lower right shown in orange, and run that through the crossfire. And then do the same thing with the mirrored image. Right. So I’ll take the central crop, then take the four corners crops. So, that’s one central crop here and here, there’s four corners crop here and here. And if you add these up that’s 10 different crops that you mentioned. So hence the name 10-crop. And so what you do, is you run these 10 images through your crossfire and then average the results. So, if you have the computational budget you could do this. Maybe you don’t need as many as 10-crops, you can use a few crops. And this might get you a little bit better performance in a production system. By production I mean a system you’re deploying for actual users. But this is another technique that is used much more for doing well on benchmarks than in actual production systems. And one of the big problems of ensembling is that you need to keep all these different networks around. And so that just takes up a lot more computer memory. For multi-crop I guess at least you keep just one network around. So it doesn’t suck up as much memory, but it still slows down your run time quite a bit. <strong>So, these are tips you see and research papers will refer to these tips as well. But I personally do not tend to use these methods when building production systems even though they are great for doing better on benchmarks and on winning competitions</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/convolutional-neural-networks/lectures/week2/images/27.png" alt=""><br><strong>Because a lot of the computer vision problems are in the small data regime, others have done a lot of hand-engineering of the network architectures. And a neural network that works well on one vision problem often may be surprisingly, but they just often would work on other vision problems as well</strong>. So, to build a practical system often you do well starting off with someone else’s neural network architecture. And you can use an open source implementation if possible, because the open source implementation might have figured out all the finicky details like the learning rate, case scheduler, and other hyper parameters. And finally someone else may have spent weeks training a model on half a dozen GP use and on over a million images. And so by using someone else’s pretrained model and fine tuning on your data set, you can often get going much faster on an application. But of course if you have the compute resources and the inclination, don’t let me stop you from training your own networks from scratch. And in fact if you want to invent your own computer vision algorithm, that’s what you might have to do.</p><p>So, that’s it for this week, I hope that seeing a number of computer vision architectures helps you get a sense of what works. In this week’s from the exercises you actually learn another program framework and use that to implement resonance. So, I hope you enjoy that exercise and I look forward to seeing you.</p>

You have now implemented the forward passes of all the layers of a convolutional network.</p><p>The remainer of this notebook is optional, and will not be graded.</p><h2 id="5-Backpropagation-in-convolutional-neural-networks-OPTIONAL-UNGRADED"><a href="#5-Backpropagation-in-convolutional-neural-networks-OPTIONAL-UNGRADED" class="headerlink" title="5 - Backpropagation in convolutional neural networks (OPTIONAL / UNGRADED)"></a>5 - Backpropagation in convolutional neural networks (OPTIONAL / UNGRADED)</h2><p>In modern deep learning frameworks, you only have to implement the forward pass, and the framework takes care of the backward pass, so most deep learning engineers don’t need to bother with the details of the backward pass. The backward pass for convolutional networks is complicated. If you wish however, you can work through this optional portion of the notebook to get a sense of what backprop in a convolutional network looks like.</p><p>When in an earlier course you implemented a simple (fully connected) neural network, you used backpropagation to compute the derivatives with respect to the cost to update the parameters. Similarly, in convolutional neural networks you can to calculate the derivatives with respect to the cost in order to update the parameters. The backprop equations are not trivial and we did not derive them in lecture, but we briefly presented them below.</p><h3 id="5-1-Convolutional-layer-backward-pass"><a href="#5-1-Convolutional-layer-backward-pass" class="headerlink" title="5.1 - Convolutional layer backward pass"></a>5.1 - Convolutional layer backward pass</h3><p>Let’s start by implementing the backward pass for a CONV layer.</p><h4 id="5-1-1-Computing-dA"><a href="#5-1-1-Computing-dA" class="headerlink" title="5.1.1 - Computing dA:"></a>5.1.1 - Computing dA:</h4><p>This is the formula for computing $dA$ with respect to the cost for a certain filter $W_c$ and a given training example:</p><p>$$dA += \sum_{h=0}^{n_H} \sum_{w=0}^{n_W} W_c \times dZ_{hw} \tag{1}$$</p><p>Where $W_c$ is a filter and $dZ_{hw}$ is a scalar corresponding to the gradient of the cost with respect to the output of the conv layer Z at the hth row and wth column (corresponding to the dot product taken at the ith stride left and jth stride down). Note that at each time, we multiply the the same filter $W_c$ by a different dZ when updating dA. We do so mainly because when computing the forward propagation, each filter is dotted and summed by a different a_slice. Therefore when computing the backprop for dA, we are just adding the gradients of all the a_slices.</p><p>In code, inside the appropriate for-loops, this formula translates into:</p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">da_prev_pad[vert_start:vert_end, horiz_start:horiz_end, :] += W[:,:,:,c] * dZ[i, h, w, c]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h4 id="5-1-2-Computing-dW"><a href="#5-1-2-Computing-dW" class="headerlink" title="5.1.2 - Computing dW:"></a>5.1.2 - Computing dW:</h4><p>This is the formula for computing $dW_c$ ($dW_c$ is the derivative of one filter) with respect to the loss:</p><p>$$ dW_c += \sum_{h=0}^{n_H} \sum_{w=0}^{n_W} a_{slice} \times dZ_{hw} \tag{2}$$</p><p>Where $a_{slice}$ corresponds to the slice which was used to generate the acitivation $Z_{ij}$.

It’s because this is the input value that ultimately influenced the output, and therefore the cost. Backprop is computing gradients with respect to the cost, so anything that influences the ultimate cost should have a non-zero gradient. So, backprop will “propagate” the gradient back to this particular input value that had influenced the cost.</p><h3 id="5-2-2-Average-pooling-backward-pass"><a href="#5-2-2-Average-pooling-backward-pass" class="headerlink" title="5.2.2 - Average pooling - backward pass"></a>5.2.2 - Average pooling - backward pass</h3><p>In max pooling, for each input window, all the “influence” on the output came from a single input value–the max. In average pooling, every element of the input window has equal influence on the output. So to implement backprop, you will now implement a helper function that reflects this.</p><p>For example if we did average pooling in the forward pass using a 2x2 filter, then the mask you’ll use for the backward pass will look like:<br>$$ dZ = 1 \quad \rightarrow \quad dZ =\begin{bmatrix}<br>1/4 &amp;&amp; 1/4 \<br>1/4 &amp;&amp; 1/4<br>\end{bmatrix}\tag{5}$$</p><p>This implies that each position in the $dZ$ matrix contributes equally to output because in the forward pass, we took an average.</p><p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Implement the function below to equally distribute a value dz through a matrix of dimension shape. <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hint</a></p><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">distribute_value</span><span class="params">(dz, shape)</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="string">"""</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    Distributes the input value in the matrix of dimension shape</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    Arguments:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    dz -- input scalar</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    shape -- the shape (n_H, n_W) of the output matrix for which we want to distribute the value of dz</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    </span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    Returns:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    a -- Array of size (n_H, n_W) for which we distributed the value of dz</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="string">    """</span></span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">### START CODE HERE ###</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Retrieve dimensions from shape (≈1 line)</span></span><br><span class="line">    (n_H, n_W) = shape;</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Compute the value to distribute on the matrix (≈1 line)</span></span><br><span class="line">    average = dz / n_H / n_W;</span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment"># Create a matrix where every entry is the "average" value (≈1 line)</span></span><br><span class="line">    a = average * np.ones((n_H, n_W));</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">### END CODE HERE ###</span></span><br><span class="line">    </span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> a</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">a = distribute_value(<span class="number">2</span>, (<span class="number">2</span>,<span class="number">2</span>))</span><br><span class="line">print(<span class="string">'distributed value ='</span>, a)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><pre><code>distributed value = [[0.5 0.5]

If you’re trying to get a learning algorithm to do a task that humans can do. And if your learning algorithm is not yet at the performance of a human. Then manually examining mistakes that your algorithm is making, can give you insights into what to do next. This process is called error analysis.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/1.png" alt=""><br>Let’s start with an example. Let’s say you’re working on your cat classifier, and you’ve achieved 90% accuracy, or equivalently 10% error, on your dev set. And let’s say this is much worse than you’re hoping to do. Maybe one of your teammates looks at some of the examples that the algorithm is misclassifying, and <strong>notices that it is miscategorizing some dogs as cats</strong>. And if you look at these two dogs, maybe they look a little bit like a cat, at least at first glance. <strong>So maybe your teammate comes to you with a proposal for how to make the algorithm do better, specifically on dogs, right? You can imagine building a focus effort, maybe to collect more dog pictures, or maybe to design features specific to dogs, or something</strong>. In order to make your cat classifier do better on dogs, so it stops misrecognizing these dogs as cats. <strong>So the question is, should you go ahead and start a project focus on the dog problem? There could be several months of works you could do in order to make your algorithm make few mistakes on dog pictures. So is that worth your effort?</strong> Well, rather than spending a few months doing this, <strong>only to risk finding out at the end that it wasn’t that helpful</strong>.</p><p>Here’s an error analysis procedure that can let you very quickly tell whether or not this could be worth your effort. <strong>Here’s what I recommend you do. First</strong>, get about, say 100 mislabeled dev set examples, then examine them manually. Just count them up one at a time, to see how many of these mislabeled examples in your dev set are actually pictures of dogs. Now, suppose that it turns out that 5% of your 100 mislabeled dev set examples are pictures of dogs. So, that is, if 5 out of 100 of these mislabeled dev set examples are dogs, what this means is that of the 100 examples. Of a typical set of 100 examples you’re getting wrong, even if you completely solve the dog problem, you only get 5 out of 100 more correct. Or in other words, <strong>if only 5% of your errors are dog pictures, then the best you could easily hope to do, if you spend a lot of time on the dog problem. Is that your error might go down from 10% error, down to 9.5% error, right? So this a 5% relative decrease in error, from 10% down to 9.5%. And so you might reasonably decide that this is not the best use of your time.</strong></p><p><strong>Or maybe it is, but at least this gives you a ceiling, right? Upper bound on how much you could improve performance by working on the dog problem, right</strong>? In machine learning, sometimes we call this <strong>the ceiling on performance</strong>. Which just means, what’s in the best case? How well could working on the dog problem help you?</p><p>But now, suppose something else happens. <strong>Suppose that we look at your 100 mislabeled dev set examples, you find that 50 of them are actually dog images. So 50% of them are dog pictures. Now you could be much more optimistic about spending time on the dog problem. In this case, if you actually solve the dog problem, your error would go down from this 10%, down to potentially 5% error. And you might decide that halving your error could be worth a lot of effort. Focus on reducing the problem of mislabeled dogs.</strong></p><p><strong>I know that in machine learning, sometimes we speak disparagingly of hand engineering things, or using too much value insight. But if you’re building applied systems, then this simple counting procedure, error analysis, can save you a lot of time. In terms of deciding what’s the most important, or what’s the most promising direction to focus on</strong>. In fact, if you’re looking at 100 mislabeled dev set examples, maybe this is a 5 to 10 minute effort. To manually go through 100 examples, and manually count up how many of them are dogs. And depending on the outcome, whether there’s more like 5%, or 50%, or something else. This, in just 5 to 10 minutes, gives you an estimate of how worthwhile this direction is. And could help you make a much better decision, whether or not to spend the next few months focused on trying to find solutions to solve the problem of mislabeled dogs.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/2.png" alt=""><br>In this slide, we’ll describe using error analysis to evaluate whether or not a single idea, dogs in this case, is worth working on. <strong>Sometimes you can also evaluate multiple ideas in parallel doing error analysis</strong>. For example, let’s say you have several ideas in improving your cat detector. Maybe you can improve performance on dogs? Or maybe you notice that sometimes, what are called great cats, such as lions, panthers, cheetahs, and so on. That they are being recognized as small cats, or house cats. So you could maybe find a way to work on that. Or maybe you find that some of your images are blurry, and it would be nice if you could design something that just works better on blurry images. And maybe you have some ideas on how to do that. So if carrying out error analysis to evaluate these three ideas, what I would do is create a table like this. And I usually do this in a spreadsheet, but using an ordinary text file will also be okay. And on the left side, this goes through the set of images you plan to look at manually. So this maybe goes from 1 to 100, if you look at 100 pictures. And the columns of this table, of the spreadsheet, will correspond to the ideas you’re evaluating. So the dog problem, the problem of great cats, and blurry images. And I usually also leave space in the spreadsheet to write comments. So remember, during error analysis, you’re just looking at dev set examples that your algorithm has misrecognized. So if you find that the first misrecognized image is a picture of a dog, then I’d put a check mark there. And to help myself remember these images, sometimes I’ll make a note in the comments. So maybe that was a pit bull picture. If the second picture was blurry, then make a note there. If the third one was a lion, on a rainy day, in the zoo that was misrecognized. Then that’s a great cat, and the blurry data. Make a note in the comment section, rainy day at zoo, and it was the rain that made it blurry, and so on. Then finally, having gone through some set of images, I would count up what percentage of these algorithms. Or what percentage of each of these error categories were attributed to the dog, or great cat, blurry categories. So maybe 8% of these images you examine turn out be dogs, and maybe 43% great cats, and 61% were blurry. So this just means going down each column, and counting up what percentage of images have a check mark in that column. As you’re part way through this process, sometimes you notice other categories of mistakes. So, for example, you might find that Instagram style filter, those fancy image filters, are also messing up your classifier. In that case, it’s actually okay, part way through the process, to add another column like that. For the multi-colored filters, the Instagram filters, and the Snapchat filters. And then go through and count up those as well, and figure out what percentage comes from that new error category. The conclusion of this process gives you an estimate of how worthwhile it might be to work on each of these different categories of errors. For example, clearly in this example, a lot of the mistakes we made on blurry images, and quite a lot on were made on great cat images. <strong>And so the outcome of this analysis is not that you must work on blurry images. This doesn’t give you a rigid mathematical formula that tells you what to do, but it gives you a sense of the best options to pursue</strong>. It also tells you, for example, that no matter how much better you do on dog images, or on Instagram images. You at most improve performance by maybe 8%, or 12%, in these examples. Whereas you can to better on great cat images, or blurry images, the potential improvement. Now there’s a ceiling in terms of how much you could improve performance, is much higher. So depending on how many ideas you have for improving performance on great cats, on blurry images. Maybe you could pick one of the two, or if you have enough personnel on your team, maybe you can have two different teams. Have one work on improving errors on great cats, and a different team work on improving errors on blurry images. <strong>But this quick counting procedure, which you can often do in, at most, small numbers of hours. Can really help you make much better prioritization decisions, and understand how promising different approaches are to work on</strong>.</p><p>So to summarize, to carry out error analysis, you should find a set of mislabeled examples, either in your dev set, or in your development set. And look at the mislabeled examples for false positives and false negatives. And just count up the number of errors that fall into various different categories. During this process, you might be inspired to generate new categories of errors, like we saw. If you’re looking through the examples and you say gee, there are a lot of Instagram filters, or Snapchat filters, they’re also messing up my classifier. You can create new categories during that process. But by counting up the fraction of examples that are mislabeled in different ways, often this will help you prioritize. Or give you inspiration for new directions to go in. Now as you’re doing error analysis, sometimes you notice that some of your examples in your dev sets are mislabeled. So what do you do about that? Let’s discuss that in the next video.</p><h3 id="02-cleaning-up-incorrectly-labeled-data"><a href="#02-cleaning-up-incorrectly-labeled-data" class="headerlink" title="02_cleaning-up-incorrectly-labeled-data"></a>02_cleaning-up-incorrectly-labeled-data</h3><p>The data for your supervised learning problem comprises input X and output labels Y. What if you going through your data and you find that some of these output labels Y are incorrect, you have data which is incorrectly labeled? Is it worth your while to go in to fix up some of these labels? Let’s take a look.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/3.png" alt=""><br>In the cat classification problem, Y equals one for cats and zero for non-cats. So, let’s say you’re looking through some data and that’s a cat, that’s not a cat, that’s a cat, that’s a cat, that’s not a cat, that’s at a cat. No, wait. That’s actually not a cat. So this is an example with an incorrect label. So I’ve used the term, mislabeled examples, to refer to if your learning algorithm outputs the wrong value of Y. But I’m going to say, incorrectly labeled examples, to refer to if in the data set you have in the training set or the dev set or the test set, the label for Y, whatever a human label assigned to this piece of data, is actually incorrect. And that’s actually a dog so that Y really should have been zero. But maybe the labeler got that one wrong. So if you find that your data has some incorrectly labeled examples, what should you do? Well, first, let’s consider the training set. <strong>It turns out that deep learning algorithms are quite robust to random errors in the training set. So long as your errors or your incorrectly labeled examples, so long as those errors are not too far from random, maybe sometimes the labeler just wasn’t paying attention or they accidentally, randomly hit the wrong key on the keyboard. If the errors are reasonably random, then it’s probably okay to just leave the errors as they are and not spend too much time fixing them. There’s certainly no harm to going into your training set and be examining the labels and fixing them. Sometimes that is worth doing but your effort might be okay even if you don’t. So long as the total data set size is big enough and the actual percentage of errors is maybe not too high</strong>. So I see a lot of machine learning algorithms that trained even when we know that there are few X mistakes in the training set labels and usually works okay. <strong>There is one caveat to this which is that deep learning algorithms are robust to random errors. They are less robust to systematic errors. So for example, if your labeler consistently labels white dogs as cats, then that is a problem because your classifier will learn to classify all white colored dogs as cats. But random errors or near random errors are usually not too bad for most deep learning algorithms</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/4.png" alt=""><br><strong>Now, this discussion has focused on what to do about incorrectly labeled examples in your training set. How about incorrectly labeled examples in your dev set or test set? If you’re worried about the impact of incorrectly labeled examples on your dev set or test set, what they recommend you do is during error analysis to add one extra column so that you can also count up the number of examples where the label Y was incorrect</strong>. So for example, maybe when you count up the impact on a 100 mislabeled dev set examples, so you’re going to find a 100 examples where your classifier’s output disagrees with the label in your dev set. And sometimes for a few of those examples, your classifier disagrees with the label because the label was wrong, rather than because your classifier was wrong. So maybe in this example, you find that the labeler missed a cat in the background. So put the check mark there to signify that example 98 had an incorrect label. And maybe for this one, the picture is actually a picture of a drawing of a cat rather than a real cat. Maybe you want the labeler to have labeled that Y equals zero rather than Y equals one. And so put another check mark there. <strong>And just as you count up the percent of errors due to other categories like we saw in the previous video, you’d also count up the fraction of percentage of errors due to incorrect labels. Where the Y value in your dev set was wrong and that accounted for why your learning algorithm made a prediction that differed from what the label on your data says</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/5.png" alt=""><br>So the question now is, is it worthwhile going in to try to fix up this 6% of incorrectly labeled examples. <strong>My advice is, if it makes a significant difference to your ability to evaluate algorithms on your dev set, then go ahead and spend the time to fix incorrect labels. But if it doesn’t make a significant difference to your ability to use the dev set to evaluate cost buyers, then it might not be the best use of your time</strong>. Let me show you an example that illustrates what I mean by this. So, three numbers I recommend you look at to try to decide if it’s worth going in and reducing the number of mislabeled examples are the following. I recommend you look at the overall dev set error. And so in the example we had from the previous video, we said that maybe our system has 90% overall accuracy. So 10% error. Then you should look at the number of errors or the percentage of errors that are due to incorrect labels. So it looks like in this case, 6% of the errors are due to incorrect labels. So 6% of 10% is 0.6%. And then you should look at errors due to all other causes. So if you made 10% error on your dev set and 0.6% of those are because the labels is wrong, then the remainder, 9.4% of them, are due to other causes such as misrecognizing dogs being cats, great cats and their images. So in this case, I would say there’s 9.4% worth of error that you could focus on fixing, whereas the errors due to incorrect labels is a relatively small fraction of the overall set of errors. So by all means, go in and fix these incorrect labels if you want but it’s maybe not the most important thing to do right now.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/6.png" alt=""><br>Now, let’s take another example. Suppose you’ve made a lot more progress on your learning problem. So instead of 10% error, let’s say you brought the errors down to 2%, but still 0.6% of your overall errors are due to incorrect labels. So now, if you want to examine a set of mislabeled dev set images, set that comes from just 2% of dev set data you’re mislabeling, then a very large fraction of them, 0.6 divided by 2%, so that is actually 30% rather than 6% of your labels. Your incorrect examples are actually due to incorrectly label examples. And so errors due to other causes are now 1.4%. When such a high fraction of your mistakes as measured on your dev set due to incorrect labels, then it maybe seems much more worthwhile to fix up the incorrect labels in your dev set. And if you remember the goal of the dev set, the main purpose of the dev set is, you want to really use it to help you select between two classifiers A and B. So you’re trying out two classifiers A and B, and one has 2.1% error and the other has 1.9% error on your dev set. But you don’t trust your dev set anymore to be correctly telling you whether this classifier is actually better than this because your 0.6% of these mistakes are due to incorrect labels. Then there’s a good reason to go in and fix the incorrect labels in your dev set. Because in this example on the right is just having a very large impact on the overall assessment of the errors of the algorithm, whereas example on the left, the percentage impact is having on your algorithm is still smaller.</p><p>Now, if you decide to go into a dev set and manually re-examine the labels and try to fix up some of the labels, <strong>here are a few additional guidelines or principles to consider.</strong> <strong>First</strong>, <strong>I would encourage you to apply whatever process you apply to both your dev and test sets at the same time.</strong> We’ve talk previously about why you want to dev and test sets to come from the same distribution. The dev set is tagging you into target and when you hit it, you want that to generalize to the test set. So your team really works more efficiently to dev and test sets come from the same distribution. So if you’re going in to fix something on the dev set, I would apply the same process to the test set to make sure that they continue to come from the same distribution. So we hire someone to examine the labels more carefully. Do that for both your dev and test sets. <strong>Second, I would urge you to consider examining examples your algorithm got right as well as ones it got wrong</strong>. It is easy to look at the examples your algorithm got wrong and just see if any of those need to be fixed. <strong>But it’s possible that there are some examples that you haven’t got right, that should also be fixed. And if you only fix ones that your algorithms got wrong, you end up with more bias estimates of the error of your algorithm. It gives your algorithm a little bit of an unfair advantage</strong>. We just try to double check what it got wrong but you don’t also double check what it got right because it might have gotten something right, that it was just lucky on fixing the label would cause it to go from being right to being wrong, on that example. <strong>The second bullet isn’t always easy to do, so it’s not always done. The reason it’s not always done is because if you classifier’s very accurate, then it’s getting fewer things wrong than right.</strong> So if your classifier has 98% accuracy, then it’s getting 2% of things wrong and 98% of things right. So it’s much easier to examine and validate the labels on 2% of the data and it takes much longer to validate labels on 98% of the data, so this isn’t always done. That’s just something to consider. <strong>Finally, if you go into a dev and test data to correct some of the labels there, you may or may not decide to go and apply the same process for the training set. Remember we said that at this other video that it’s actually less important to correct the labels in your training set. And it’s quite possible you decide to just correct the labels in your dev and test set which are also often smaller than a training set and you might not invest all that extra effort needed to correct the labels in a much larger training set.</strong> This is actually okay. We’ll talk later this week about some processes for handling when your training data is different in distribution than you dev and test data. Learning algorithms are quite robust to that. <strong>It’s super important that your dev and test sets come from the same distribution. But if your training set comes from a slightly different distribution, often that’s a pretty reasonable thing to do. I will talk more about how to handle this later this week.</strong></p><p>So I’d like to wrap up with just a couple of pieces of advice. <strong>First</strong>, deep learning researchers sometimes like to say things like, “I just fed the data to the algorithm. I trained in and it worked.” There is a lot of truth to that in the deep learning error. There is more of feeding data in algorithm and just training it and doing less hand engineering and using less human insight. But <strong>I think that in building practical systems, often there’s also more manual error analysis and more human insight that goes into the systems than sometimes deep learning researchers like to acknowledge</strong>.</p><p>Second is that somehow I’ve seen some engineers and researchers be reluctant to manually look at the examples. Maybe it’s not the most interesting thing to do, to sit down and look at a 100 or a couple hundred examples to counter the number of errors. But this is something that I so do myself. <strong>When I’m leading a machine learning team and I want to understand what mistakes it is making, I would actually go in and look at the data myself and try to counter the fraction of errors. And I think that because these minutes or maybe a small number of hours of counting data can really help you prioritize where to go next. I find this a very good use of your time and I urge you to consider doing it if those machines are in your system and you’re trying to decide what ideas or what directions to prioritize things. So that’s it for the error analysis process.</strong> In the next video, I want to share a view of some thoughts on how error analysis fits in to how you might go about starting out on the new machine learning project.</p><h3 id="03-build-your-first-system-quickly-then-iterate"><a href="#03-build-your-first-system-quickly-then-iterate" class="headerlink" title="03_build-your-first-system-quickly-then-iterate"></a>03_build-your-first-system-quickly-then-iterate</h3><p><strong>If you’re working on a brand new machine learning application, one of the piece of advice I often give people is that, I think you should build your first system quickly and then iterate</strong>. Let me show you what I mean.</p><p>I’ve worked on speech recognition for many years. <strong>And if you’re thinking of building a new speech recognition system, there’s actually a lot of directions you could go and a lot of things you could prioritize.</strong></p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/7.png" alt=""><br>For example, there are specific techniques for making speech recognition systems more robust to noisy background. And noisy background could mean cafe noise, like a lot of people talking in the background or car noise, the sounds of cars and highways or other types of noise. There are ways to make a speech recognition system more robust to accented speech. There are specific problems associated with speakers that are far from the microphone, this is called far-field speech recognition. Young children speech poses special challenges, both in terms of how they pronounce individual words as well as their choice of words and the vocabulary they tend to use. And if sometimes the speaker stutters or if they use nonsensical phrases like oh, ah, um, there are different choices and different techniques for making the transcript that you output, still read more fluently. So, there are these and many other things you could do to improve a speech recognition system. <strong>And more generally, for almost any machine learning application, there could be 50 different directions you could go in and each of these directions is reasonable and would make your system better. But the challenge is, how do you pick which of these to focus on.</strong> And even though I’ve worked in speech recognition for many years, if I’m building a new system for a new application domain, I would still find it maybe a little bit difficult to pick without spending some time thinking about the problem. So what we recommend you do, if you’re starting on building a brand new machine learning application, is to build your first system quickly and then iterate. What I mean by that is I recommend that you first quickly set up a dev/test set and metric. So this is really deciding where to place your target. And if you get it wrong, you can always move it later, but just set up a target somewhere. And then I recommend you build an initial machine learning system quickly. Find the training set, train it and see. Start to see and understand how well you’re doing against your dev/test set and your values and metric. When you build your initial system, you then be able to use bias/variance analysis which we talked about earlier as well as error analysis which we talked about just in the last several videos, to prioritize the next steps. In particular, if error analysis causes you to realize that a lot of the errors are from the speaker being very far from the microphone, which causes special challenges to speech recognition, then that will give you a good reason to focus on techniques to address this called far-field speech recognition which basically means handling when the speaker is very far from the microphone. <strong>Of all the value of building this initial system, it can be a quick and dirty implementation, you know, don’t overthink it, but all the value of the initial system is having some learned system, having some trained system allows you to localize bias/variance, to try to prioritize what to do next, allows you to do error analysis, look at some mistakes, to figure out all the different directions you can go in, which ones are actually the most worthwhile.</strong></p><p><strong>So to recap, what I recommend you do is build your first system quickly, then iterate. This advice applies less strongly if you’re working on an application area in which you have significant prior experience. It also applies to build less strongly if there’s a significant body of academic literature that you can draw on for pretty much the exact same problem you’re building.</strong> So, for example, there’s a large academic literature on face recognition. And if you’re trying to build a face recognizer, it might be okay to build a more complex system from the get-go by building on this large body of academic literature. But if you are tackling a new problem for the first time, then I would encourage you to really not overthink or not make your first system too complicated. Well, just build something quick and dirty and then use that to help you prioritize how to improve your system.</p><p>So I’ve seen a lot of machine learning projects and I’ve seen some teams overthink the solution and build something too complicated. I’ve also seen some teams underthink and then build something maybe too simple. Well on average, I’ve seen a lot more teams overthink and build something too complicated. And I’ve seen teams build something too simple. So I hope this helps, and if you are applying to your machine learning algorithms to a new application, and <strong>if your main goal is to build something that works, as opposed to if your main goal is to invent a new machine learning algorithm which is a different goal, then your main goal is to get something that works really well. I’d encourage you to build something quick and dirty. Use that to do bias/variance analysis, use that to do error analysis and use the results of those analysis to help you prioritize where to go next</strong>.</p><h2 id="02-mismatched-training-and-dev-test-set"><a href="#02-mismatched-training-and-dev-test-set" class="headerlink" title="02_mismatched-training-and-dev-test-set"></a>02_mismatched-training-and-dev-test-set</h2><h3 id="01-training-and-testing-on-different-distributions"><a href="#01-training-and-testing-on-different-distributions" class="headerlink" title="01_training-and-testing-on-different-distributions"></a>01_training-and-testing-on-different-distributions</h3><p>Deep learning algorithms have a huge hunger for training data. They just often work best when you can find enough label training data to put into the training set. This has resulted in many teams sometimes taking whatever data you can find and just shoving it into the training set just to get it more training data. Even if some of this data, or even maybe a lot of this data, doesn’t come from the same distribution as your dev and test data. So in a deep learning era, more and more teams are now training on data that comes from a different distribution than your dev and test sets. And there’s some subtleties and some best practices for dealing with when you’re training and test distributions differ from each other. Let’s take a look.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/8.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say that you’re building a mobile app where users will upload pictures taken from their cell phones, and you want to recognize whether the pictures that your users upload from the mobile app is a cat or not. <strong>So you can now get two sources of data. One which is the distribution of data you really care about, this data from a mobile app like that on the right, which tends to be less professionally shot, less well framed, maybe even blurrier because it’s shot by amateur users. The other source of data you can get is you can crawl the web and just download a lot of, for the sake of this example, let’s say you can download a lot of very professionally framed, high resolution, professionally taken images of cats</strong>. And let’s say you don’t have a lot of users yet for your mobile app. So maybe you’ve gotten 10,000 pictures uploaded from the mobile app. But by crawling the web you can download huge numbers of cat pictures, and maybe you have 200,000 pictures of cats downloaded off the Internet. So what you really care about is that your final system does well on the mobile app distribution of images, right? Because in the end, your users will be uploading pictures like those on the right and you need your classifier to do well on that. But you now have a bit of a dilemma because you have a relatively small dataset, just 10,000 examples drawn from that distribution. And you have a much bigger dataset that’s drawn from a different distribution. There’s a different appearance of image than the one you actually want. <strong>So you don’t want to use just those 10,000 images because it ends up giving you a relatively small training set. And using those 200,000 images seems helpful, but the dilemma is this 200,000 images isn’t from exactly the distribution you want</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/9.png" alt=""></p><p>So what can you do? Well, here’s one option. One thing you can do is put both of these data sets together so you now have 210,000 images. <strong>And you can then take the 210,000 images and randomly shuffle them into a train, dev, and test set. And let’s say for the sake of argument that you’ve decided that your dev and test sets will be 2,500 examples each</strong>. So your training set will be 205,000 examples. Now so set up your data this way has some advantages but also disadvantages. <strong>The advantage is that now you’re training, dev and test sets will all come from the same distribution, so that makes it easier to manage. But the disadvantage, and this is a huge disadvantage, is that if you look at your dev set, of these 2,500 examples, a lot of it will come from the web page distribution of images, rather than what you actually care about, which is the mobile app distribution of images.</strong> So it turns out that of your total amount of data, 200,000, so I’ll just abbreviate that 200k, out of 210,000, we’ll write that as 210k, that comes from web pages. So all of these 2,500 examples on expectation, I think 2,381 of them will come from web pages. This is on expectation, the exact number will vary around depending on how the random shuttle operation went. But on average, only 119 will come from mobile app uploads. So remember that setting up your dev set is telling your team where to aim the target. And the way you’re aiming your target, you’re saying spend most of the time optimizing for the web page distribution of images, which is really not what you want. So I would recommend against option one, because this is setting up the dev set to tell your team to optimize for a different distribution of data than what you actually care about. <strong>So instead of doing this, I would recommend that you instead take another option, which is the following. The training set, let’s say it’s still 205,000 images, I would have the training set have all 200,000 images from the web.</strong> And then you can, if you want, add in 5,000 images from the mobile app. And then for your dev and test sets, I guess my data sets size aren’t drawn to scale. <strong>Your dev and test sets would be all mobile app images. So the training set will include 200,000 images from the web and 5,000 from the mobile app. The dev set will be 2,500 images from the mobile app, and the test set will be 2,500 images also from the mobile app. The advantage of this way of splitting up your data into train, dev, and test, is that you’re now aiming the target where you want it to be.</strong> You’re telling your team, my dev set has data uploaded from the mobile app and that’s the distribution of images you really care about, so let’s try to build a machine learning system that does really well on the mobile app distribution of images. The disadvantage, of course, is that now your training distribution is different from your dev and test set distributions. But it turns out that this split of your data into train, dev and test will get you better performance over the long term. And we’ll discuss later some specific techniques for dealing with your training sets coming from different distribution than your dev and test sets.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/10.png" alt=""><br>Let’s look at another example. Let’s say you’re building a brand new product, <strong>a speech activated rearview mirror for a car</strong>. So this is a real product in China. It’s making its way into other countries but you can build a rearview mirror to replace this little thing there, so that you can now talk to the rearview mirror and basically say, dear rearview mirror, please help me find navigational directions to the nearest gas station and it’ll deal with it. So this is actually a real product, and let’s say you’re trying to build this for your own country. So how can you get data to train up a speech recognition system for this product? Well, maybe you’ve worked on speech recognition for a long time so you have a lot of data from other speech recognition applications, just not from a speech activated rearview mirror. Here’s how you could split up your training and your dev and test sets. So for your training, you can take all the speech data you have that you’ve accumulated from working on other speech problems, such as data you purchased over the years from various speech recognition data vendors. And today you can actually buy data from vendors of x, y pairs, where x is an audio clip and y is a transcript. Or maybe you’ve worked on smart speakers, smart voice activated speakers, so you have some data from that. Maybe you’ve worked on voice activated keyboards and so on. And for the sake of argument, maybe you have 500,000 utterences from all of these sources. And for your dev and test set, maybe you have a much smaller data set that actually came from a speech activated rearview mirror. Because users are asking for navigational queries or trying to find directions to various places. This data set will maybe have a lot more street addresses, right? Please help me navigate to this street address, or please help me navigate to this gas station. So this distribution of data will be very different than these on the left. But this is really the data you care about, because this is what you need your product to do well on, so this is what you set your dev and test set to be. So what you do in this example is set your training set to be the 500,000 utterances on the left, and then your dev and test sets which I’ll abbreviate D and T, these could be maybe 10,000 utterances each. That’s drawn from actual the speech activated rearview mirror. Or alternatively, if you think you don’t need to put all 20,000 examples from your speech activated rearview mirror into the dev and test sets, maybe you can take half of that and put that in the training set. So then the training set could be 510,000 utterances, including all 500 from there and 10,000 from the rearview mirror. And then the dev and test sets could maybe be 5,000 utterances each. So of the 20,000 utterances, maybe 10k goes into the training set and 5k into the dev set and 5,000 into the test set. So this would be another reasonable way of splitting your data into train, dev, and test. And this gives you a much bigger training set, over 500,000 utterances, than if you were to only use speech activated rearview mirror data for your training set.</p><p>So in this video, you’ve seen a couple examples of when allowing your training set data to come from a different distribution than your dev and test set allows you to have much more training data. And in these examples, it will cause your learning algorithm to perform better. <strong>Now one question you might ask is, should you always use all the data you have? The answer is subtle, it is not always yes. Let’s look at a counter-example in the next video</strong>.</p><h3 id="02-bias-and-variance-with-mismatched-data-distributions"><a href="#02-bias-and-variance-with-mismatched-data-distributions" class="headerlink" title="02_bias-and-variance-with-mismatched-data-distributions"></a>02_bias-and-variance-with-mismatched-data-distributions</h3><p>Estimating the bias and variance of your learning algorithm really helps you prioritize what to work on next. But <strong>the way you analyze bias and variance changes when your training set comes from a different distribution than your dev and test sets.</strong> Let’s see how.</p><p>Let’s keep using our cat classification example and let’s say humans get near perfect performance on this. So, Bayes error, or <strong>Bayes optimal error, we know is nearly 0% on this problem</strong>. So, to carry out error analysis you usually look at the training error and also look at the error on the dev set. So let’s say, in this example that your <strong>training error is 1%</strong>, and <strong>your dev error is 10%</strong>. If your dev data came from the same distribution as your training set, you would say that here you have a large variance problem, that your algorithm’s just not generalizing well from the training set which it’s doing well on to the dev set, which it’s suddenly doing much worse on. But in the setting where your training data and your dev data comes from a different distribution, you can no longer safely draw this conclusion. In particular, maybe it’s doing just fine on the dev set, it’s just that the training set was really easy because it was high res, very clear images, and maybe the dev set is just much harder. So maybe there isn’t a variance problem and this just reflects that the dev set contains images that are much more difficult to classify accurately. <strong>So the problem with this analysis is that when you went from the training error to the dev error, two things changed at a time. One is that the algorithm saw data in the training set but not in the dev set. Two, the distribution of data in the dev set is different. And because you changed two things at the same time, it’s difficult to know of this 9% increase in error, how much of it is because the algorithm didn’t see the data in the dev set, so that’s some of the variance part of the problem. And how much of it, is because the dev set data is just different.</strong> So, in order to tease out these two effects, and if you didn’t totally follow what these two different effects are, don’t worry, we will go over it again in a second. But in order to tease out these two effects it will be useful to define a new piece of data which we’ll call the <strong>training-dev set</strong>. So, <strong>this is a new subset of data, which we carve out that should have the same distribution as training sets, but you don’t explicitly train in your network on this</strong>. So here’s what I mean. Previously we had set up some training sets and some dev sets and some test sets as follows. <strong>And the dev and test sets have the same distribution, but the training sets will have some different distribution. What we’re going to do is randomly shuffle the training sets and then carve out just a piece of the training set to be the training-dev set. So just as the dev and test set have the same distribution, the training set and the training-dev set, also have the same distribution</strong>. But, the difference is that now you train your neural network, just on the training set proper. <strong>You won’t let the neural network, you won’t run that obligation on the training-dev portion of this data. To carry out error analysis, what you should do is now look at the error of your classifier on the training set, on the training-dev set, as well as on the dev set</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/11.png" alt=""><br>So let’s say in this example that your <strong>training error is 1%</strong>. And let’s say <strong>the error on the training-dev set is 9%</strong>, and <strong>the error on the dev set is 10%</strong>, same as before. What you can conclude from this is that when you went from training data to training dev data the error really went up a lot. And only the difference between the training data and the training-dev data is that your neural network got to sort the first part of this. It was trained explicitly on this, but it wasn’t trained explicitly on the training-dev data. So this tells you that you have a variance problem. Because the training-dev error was measured on data that comes from the same distribution as your training set. <strong>So you know that even though your neural network does well in a training set, it’s just not generalizing well to data in the training-dev set which comes from the same distribution, but it’s just not generalizing well to data from the same distribution that it hadn’t seen before. So in this example we have really a variance problem</strong>.</p><p>Let’s look at a different example. Let’s say <strong>the training error is 1%</strong>, and <strong>the training-dev error is 1.5%</strong>, but when you go to <strong>the dev set your error is 10%</strong>. So now, you have actually a pretty low variance problem, because when you went from training data that you’ve seen to the training-dev data that the neural network has not seen, the error increases only a little bit, but then it really jumps when you go to the dev set. <strong>So this is a data mismatch problem, where data mismatched. So this is a data mismatch problem, because your learning algorithm was not trained explicitly on data from training-dev or dev, but these two data sets come from different distributions. But whatever algorithm it’s learning, it works great on training-dev but it doesn’t work well on dev. So somehow your algorithm has learned to do well on a different distribution than what you really care about, so we call that a data mismatch problem</strong>.</p><p>Let’s just look at a few more examples. I’ll write this on the next row since I’m running out of space on top. So Training error, Training-Dev error, and Dev error. Let’s say that <strong>training error is 10%</strong>, <strong>training-dev error is 11%</strong>, and <strong>dev error is 12%</strong>. Remember that <strong>human level proxy for Bayes error is roughly 0%.</strong> So if you have this type of performance, <strong>then you really have a bias, an avoidable bias problem</strong>, because you’re doing much worse than human level. So this is really a high bias setting.</p><p>And one last example. If your <strong>training error is 10%, your training-dev error is 11% and your dev error is 20 %</strong>, then it looks like <strong>this actually has two issues</strong>. <strong>One, the avoidable bias is quite high</strong>, because you’re not even doing that well on the training set. <strong>Humans get nearly 0% error</strong>, but you’re getting 10% error on your training set. The variance here seems quite small, but this data mismatch is quite large. <strong>So for for this example I will say, you have a large bias or avoidable bias problem as well as a data mismatch problem</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/12.png" alt=""><br>So let’s take what we’ve done on this slide and write out the general principles. <strong>The key quantities I would look at are human level error, your training set error, your training-dev set error. So that’s the same distribution as the training set, but you didn’t train explicitly on it. Your dev set error, and depending on the differences between these errors, you can get a sense of how big is the avoidable bias, the variance, the data mismatch problems</strong>. So let’s say that human level error is 4%. Your training error is 7%. And your training-dev error is 10%. And the dev error is 12%. So this gives you a sense of the avoidable bias. because you know, you’d like your algorithm to do at least as well or approach human level performance maybe on the training set. This is a sense of the variance. So how well do you generalize from the training set to the training-dev set? This is the sense of how much of a data mismatch problem have you have. And technically you could also add one more thing, which is the test set performance, and we’ll write test error. You shouldn’t be doing development on your test set because you don’t want to overfit your test set. But if you also look at this, then this gap here tells you the degree of overfitting to the dev set. <strong>So if there’s a huge gap between your dev set performance and your test set performance, it means you maybe overtuned to the dev set.</strong> And so maybe you need to find a bigger dev set, right? So remember that <strong>your dev set and your test set come from the same distribution. So the only way for there to be a huge gap here, for it to do much better on the dev set than the test set, is if you somehow managed to overfit the dev set. And if that’s the case, what you might consider doing is going back and just getting more dev set data</strong>. Now, I’ve written these numbers, as you go down the list of numbers, always keep going up.</p><p>Here’s one example of numbers that doesn’t always go up, maybe <strong>human level performance is 4%</strong>, <strong>training error is 7%</strong>, <strong>training-dev error is 10</strong>%, but let’s say that we go to the dev set. You find that you actually, <strong>surprisingly, do much better on the dev set. Maybe this is 6%, 6% as well.</strong> So you have seen effects like this, working on for example a speech recognition task, where the training data turned out to be much harder than your dev set and test set. So these two were evaluated on your training set distribution and these two were evaluated on your dev/test set distribution. So sometimes if your dev/test set distribution is much easier for whatever application you’re working on then these numbers can actually go down. So if you see funny things like this, there’s an even more general formulation of this analysis that might be helpful. Let me quickly explain that on the next slide.</p><p>So, let me motivate this using the speech activated rear-view mirror example. <strong>It turns out that the numbers we’ve been writing down can be placed into a table</strong> where on the horizontal axis, I’m going to place different data sets. So for example, you might have data from your general speech recognition task. So you might have a bunch of data that you just collected from a lot of speech recognition problems you worked on from small speakers, data you have purchased and so on. And then you all have the rear view mirror specific speech data, recorded inside the car. So on this x axis on the table, I’m going to vary the data set. On this other axis, I’m going to label different ways or algorithms for examining the data.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/13.png" alt=""><br>So first, there’s human level performance, which is how accurate are humans on each of these data sets? Then there is the error on the examples that your neural network has trained on. And then finally there’s error on the examples that your neural network has not trained on. So turns out that what we’re calling on a human level on the previous slide, there’s the number that goes in this box, which is how well do humans do on this category of data. Say data from all sorts of speech recognition tasks, the thousand utterances that you could into your training set. And the example in the previous slide is this 4%. This number here was our, maybe the training error. Which in the example in the previous slide was 7% Right, if you’re learning algorithm has seen this example, performed gradient descent on this example, and this example came from your training set distribution, or some general speech recognition distribution. How well does your algorithm do on the example it has trained on? Then here is the training-dev set error. It’s usually a bit higher, which is for data from this distribution, from general speech recognition, if your algorithm did not train explicitly on some examples from this distribution, how well does it do? And that’s what we call the training dev error. And then if you move over to the right, this box here is the dev set error, or maybe also the test set error. Which was 6% in the example just now. And dev and test error, it’s actually technically two numbers, but either one could go into this box here. And this is if you have data from your rearview mirror, from actually recorded in the car from the rearview mirror application, but your neural network did not perform back propagation on this example, what is the error? So what we’re doing in the analysis in the previous slide was look at differences between these two numbers, these two numbers, and these two numbers. And this gap here is a measure of avoidable bias. This gap here is a measure of variance, and this gap here was a measure of data mismatch. And it turns out that it could be useful to also throw in the remaining two entries in this table. And so if this turns out to be also 6%, and the way you get this number is you ask some humans to label their rearview mirror speech data and just measure how good humans are at this task. And maybe this turns out also to be 6%. And the way you do that is you take some rearview mirror speech data, put it in the training set so the neural network learns on it as well, and then you measure the error on that subset of the data. But if this is what you get, then, well, it turns out that you’re actually already performing at the level of humans on this rearview mirror speech data, so maybe you’re actually doing quite well on that distribution of data. When you do this more subsequent analysis, it doesn’t always give you one clear path forward, but sometimes it just gives you additional insights as well. So for example, comparing these two numbers in this case tells us that for humans, the rearview mirror speech data is actually harder than for general speech recognition, because humans get 6% error, rather than 4% error. But then looking at these differences as well may help you understand bias and variance and data mismatch problems in different degrees. So this more general formulation is something I’ve used a few times. I’ve not used it, but for a lot of problems you find that examining this subset of entries, kind of looking at this difference and this difference and this difference, that that’s enough to point you in a pretty promising direction. But sometimes filling out this whole table can give you additional insights.</p><p>Finally, we’ve previously talked a lot about ideas for addressing bias. Talked about techniques on addressing variance, but how do you address data mismatch? In particular training on data that comes from different distribution that your dev and test set can get you more data and really help your learning algorithm’s performance. But rather than just bias and variance problems, you now have this new potential problem of data mismatch. What are some good ways that you could use to address data mismatch? I’ll be honest and say there actually aren’t great or at least not very systematic ways to address data mismatch. But there are some things you could try that could help. Let’s take a look at them in the next video. So what we’ve seen is that by using training data that can come from a different distribution as a dev and test set, this could give you a lot more data and therefore help the performance of your learning algorithm. <strong>But instead of just having bias and variance as two potential problems, you now have this third potential problem, data mismatch. So what if you perform error analysis and conclude that data mismatch is a huge source of error, how do you go about addressing that? It turns out that unfortunately there are super systematic ways to address data mismatch, but there are a few things you can try that could help</strong>. Let’s take a look at them in the next video.</p><h3 id="03-addressing-data-mismatch"><a href="#03-addressing-data-mismatch" class="headerlink" title="03_addressing-data-mismatch"></a>03_addressing-data-mismatch</h3><p>If your training set comes from a different distribution, than your dev and test set, and if error analysis shows you that you have a data mismatch problem, what can you do? There are completely systematic solutions to this, but let’s look at some things you could try.</p><p><strong>If I find that I have a large data mismatch problem, what I usually do is carry out manual error analysis and try to understand the differences between the training set and the dev/test sets. To avoid overfitting the test set, technically for error analysis, you should manually only look at a dev set and not at the test set</strong>.</p><p>But as a concrete example, if you’re building the <strong>speech-activated rear-view mirror application</strong>, you might look or, I guess if it’s speech, listen to examples in your dev set to try to figure out how your dev set is different than your training set.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/14.png" alt=""><br>So, for example, you might find that a lot of dev set examples are very noisy and there’s <strong>a lot of car noise</strong>. And this is one way that your dev set differs from your training set. And maybe you find other categories of errors. For example, in the speech-activated rear-view mirror in your car, you might find that it’s often <strong>mis-recognizing street numbers</strong> because there are <strong>a lot more navigational queries which will have street address. So, getting street numbers right is really important. When you have insight into the nature of the dev set errors, or you have insight into how the dev set may be different or harder than your training set, what you can do is then try to find ways to make the training data more similar. Or, alternatively, try to collect more data similar to your dev and test sets</strong>.</p><p>So, <strong>for example, if you find that car noise in the background is a major source of error, one thing you could do is simulate noisy in-car data</strong>. So a little bit more about how to do this on the next slide. Or you find that you’re having a hard time recognizing street numbers, maybe you can go and deliberately try to get more data of people speaking out numbers and add that to your training set. Now, I realize that this slide is giving a rough guideline for things you could try. <strong>This isn’t a systematic process and, I guess, it’s no guarantee that you get the insights you need to make progress. But I have found that this manual insight, together we’re trying to make the data more similar on the dimensions that matter that this often helps on a lot of the problems.</strong> So, if your goal is to make the training data more similar to your dev set, what are some things you can do?</p><p>One of the techniques you can use is artificial data synthesis and let’s discuss that in the context of addressing the car noise problem. So, to build a speech recognition system, maybe you don’t have a lot of audio that was actually recorded inside the car with the background noise of a car, background noise of a highway, and so on. But, it turns out, there’s a way to synthesize it. So, let’s say that you’ve recorded a large amount of clean audio without this car background noise. So, here’s an example of a clip you might have in your training set.<br><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/15.png" alt=""><br>By the way, this sentence is used a lot in AI for testing because this is a short sentence that contains every alphabet from A to Z, so you see this sentence a lot. But, given that recording of “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,” you can then also get a recording of car noise like this. So, that’s what the inside of a car sounds like, if you’re driving in silence. And if you take these two audio clips and add them together, you can then synthesize what saying “the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” would sound like, if you were saying that in a noisy car. So, it sounds like this. So, <strong>this is a relatively simple audio synthesis example</strong>. In practice, you might synthesize other audio effects like reverberation which is the sound of your voice bouncing off the walls of the car and so on. <strong>But through artificial data synthesis, you might be able to quickly create more data that sounds like it was recorded inside the car without needing to go out there and collect tons of data, maybe thousands or tens of thousands of hours of data in a car that’s actually driving along. So, if your error analysis shows you that you should try to make your data sound more like it was recorded inside the car, then this could be a reasonable process for synthesizing that type of data to give you a learning algorithm</strong>.</p><p><strong>Now, there is one note of caution I want to sound on artificial data synthesis</strong> which is that, let’s say, you have 10,000 hours of data that was recorded against a quiet background. And, let’s say, that you have just one hour of car noise. <strong>So, one thing you could try is take this one hour of car noise and repeat it 10,000 times in order to add to this 10,000 hours of data recorded against a quiet background. If you do that, the audio will sound perfectly fine to the human ear, but there is a chance, there is a risk that your learning algorithm will over fit to the one hour of car noise.</strong> And, in particular, if this is the set of all audio that you could record in the car or, maybe the sets of all car noise backgrounds you can imagine, if you have just one hour of car noise background, you might be simulating just a very small subset of this space. You might be just synthesizing from a very small subset of this space. <strong>And to the human ear, all these audio sounds just fine because one hour of car noise sounds just like any other hour of car noise to the human ear. But, it’s possible that you’re synthesizing data from a very small subset of this space, and the neural network might be overfitting to the one hour of car noise that you may have. I don’t know if it will be practically feasible to inexpensively collect 10,000 hours of car noise so that you don’t need to repeat the same one hour of car noise over and over but you have 10,000 unique hours of car noise to add to 10,000 hours of unique audio recording against a clean background. But it’s possible, no guarantees. But it is possible that using 10,000 hours of unique car noise rather than just one hour, that could result in better performance through learning algorithm</strong>. And the challenge with artificial data synthesis is to the human ear, as far as your ears can tell, these 10,000 hours all sound the same as this one hour, so you might end up creating this very impoverished synthesized data set from a much smaller subset of the space without actually realizing it.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/16.png" alt=""><br>Here’s another example of artificial data synthesis. Let’s say you’re <strong>building a self driving car</strong> and so you want to really detect vehicles like this and put a bounding box around it let’s say. <strong>So, one idea that a lot of people have discussed is, well, why should you use computer graphics to simulate tons of images of cars?</strong> And, in fact, here are a couple of pictures of cars that were generated using computer graphics. And I think these graphics effects are actually pretty good and I can imagine that by synthesizing pictures like these, you could train a pretty good computer vision system for detecting cars. <strong>Unfortunately, the picture that I drew on the previous slide again applies in this setting. Maybe this is the set of all cars and, if you synthesize just a very small subset of these cars, then to the human eye, maybe the synthesized images look fine. But you might overfit to this small subset you’re synthesizing</strong>. In particular, one idea that a lot of people have independently raised is, once you find a video game with good computer graphics of cars and just grab images from them and get a huge data set of pictures of cars, it turns out that if you look at a video game, if the video game has just 20 unique cars in the video game, then the video game looks fine because you’re driving around in the video game and you see these 20 other cars and it looks like a pretty realistic simulation. But the world has a lot more than 20 unique designs of cars, and if your entire synthesized training set has only 20 distinct cars, then your neural network will probably overfit to these 20 cars. <strong>And it’s difficult for a person to easily tell that, even though these images look realistic, you’re really covering such a tiny subset of the sets of all possible cars.</strong></p><p><strong>So, to summarize, if you think you have a data mismatch problem, I recommend you do error analysis, or look at the training set, or look at the dev set to try this figure out, to try to gain insight into how these two distributions of data might differ. And then see if you can find some ways to get more training data that looks a bit more like your dev set. One of the ways we talked about is artificial data synthesis. And artificial data synthesis does work.</strong> In speech recognition, I’ve seen artificial data synthesis significantly boost the performance of what were already very good speech recognition system. So, it can work very well. <strong>But, if you’re using artificial data synthesis, just be cautious and bear in mind whether or not you might be accidentally simulating data only from a tiny subset of the space of all possible examples. So, that’s it for how to deal with data mismatch.</strong> Next, I like to share with you some thoughts on how to learn from multiple types of data at the same time.</p><h2 id="03-learning-from-multiple-tasks"><a href="#03-learning-from-multiple-tasks" class="headerlink" title="03_learning-from-multiple-tasks"></a>03_learning-from-multiple-tasks</h2><h3 id="01-transfer-learning"><a href="#01-transfer-learning" class="headerlink" title="01_transfer-learning"></a>01_transfer-learning</h3><p>One of the most powerful ideas in deep learning is that sometimes you can take knowledge the neural network has learned from one task and apply that knowledge to a separate task.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/18.png" alt=""><br>So for example, maybe you could have the neural network learn to recognize objects like cats and then use that knowledge or use part of that knowledge to help you do a better job reading x-ray scans. This is called <strong>transfer learning</strong>. Let’s take a look. <strong>Let’s say you’ve trained your neural network on image recognition. So you first take a neural network and train it on X Y pairs, where X is an image and Y is some object. An image is a cat or a dog or a bird or something else. If you want to take this neural network and adapt, or we say transfer, what is learned to a different task</strong>, such as radiology diagnosis, meaning really reading X-ray scans, <strong>what you can do is take this last output layer of the neural network and just delete that and delete also the weights feeding into that last output layer and create a new set of randomly initialized weights just for the last layer</strong> and have that now output radiology diagnosis. So to be concrete, during the first phase of training when you’re training on an image recognition task, you train all of the usual parameters for the neural network, all the weights, all the layers and you have something that now learns to make image recognition predictions.</p><p><strong>Having trained that neural network, what you now do to implement transfer learning is</strong> swap in a new data set X Y, where now these are radiology images. And Y are the diagnoses you want to predict and <strong>what you do is initialize the last layers’ weights. Let’s call that W.L. and P.L. randomly. And now, retrain the neural network on this new data set, on the new radiology data set.</strong> You have a couple options of how you retrain neural network with radiology data. You might, if you have a small radiology dataset, you might want to just retrain the weights of the last layer, just W.L. P.L., and keep the rest of the parameters fixed. If you have enough data, you could also retrain all the layers of the rest of the neural network. <strong>And the rule of thumb is maybe if you have a small data set, then just retrain the one last layer at the output layer. Or maybe that last one or two layers. But if you have a lot of data, then maybe you can retrain all the parameters in the network.</strong> And if you retrain all the parameters in the neural network, then this initial phase of training on image recognition is sometimes called <strong>pre-training</strong>, because you’re using image recognitions data to pre-initialize or really pre-train the weights of the neural network. And then if you are updating all the weights afterwards, then training on the radiology data sometimes that’s called <strong>fine tuning</strong>. <strong>So you hear the words pre-training and fine tuning in a deep learning context, this is what they mean when they refer to pre-training and fine tuning weights in a transfer learning source.</strong></p><p>And what you’ve done in this example, is you’ve taken knowledge learned from image recognition and applied it or transferred it to radiology diagnosis. And the reason this can be helpful is that a lot of the low level features such as detecting edges, detecting curves, detecting positive objects. Learning from that, from a very large image recognition data set, might help your learning algorithm do better in radiology diagnosis. It’s just learned a lot about the structure and the nature of how images look like and some of that knowledge will be useful. <strong>So having learned to recognize images, it might have learned enough about you know, just what parts of different images look like, that that knowledge about lines, dots, curves, and so on, maybe small parts of objects, that knowledge could help your radiology diagnosis network learn a bit faster or learn with less data</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/19.png" alt=""><br>Here’s another example. Let’s say that you’ve trained <strong>a speech recognition system</strong> so now <strong>X is input of audio or audio snippets, and Y is some ink transcript</strong>. So you’ve trained in speech recognition system to output your transcripts. And let’s say that <strong>you now want to build a “wake words” or a “trigger words” detection system</strong>. So, recall that a wake word or the trigger word are the words we say in order to wake up speech control devices in our houses such as saying “Alexa” to wake up an Amazon Echo or “OK Google” to wake up a Google device or “hey Siri” to wake up an Apple device or saying “Ni hao baidu” to wake up a baidu device. <strong>So in order to do this, you might take out the last layer of the neural network again and create a new output node. But sometimes another thing you could do is actually create not just a single new output, but actually create several new layers to your neural network to try to put the labels Y for your wake word detection problem. Then again, depending on how much data you have, you might just retrain the new layers of the network or maybe you could retrain even more layers of this neural network.</strong></p><p>So, when does transfer learning make sense? <strong>Transfer learning makes sense when you have a lot of data for the problem you’re transferring from and usually relatively less data for the problem you’re transferring to</strong>.</p><p>So for example, let’s say you have a million examples for image recognition task. So that’s a lot of data to learn a lot of low level features or to learn a lot of useful features in the earlier layers in neural network. But for the radiology task, maybe you have only a hundred examples. So you have very low data for the radiology diagnosis problem, maybe only 100 x-ray scans. So a lot of knowledge you learn from English recognition can be transferred and can really help you get going with radiology recognition even if you don’t have all the data for radiology. For speech recognition, maybe you’ve trained the speech recognition system on 10000 hours of data. So, you’ve learned a lot about what human voices sounds like from that 10000 hours of data, which really is a lot.</p><p>But for your trigger word detection, maybe you have only one hour of data. So, that’s not a lot of data to fit a lot of parameters. So in this case, a lot of what you learn about what human voices sound like, what are components of human speech and so on, that can be really helpful for building a good wake word detector, even though you have a relatively small dataset or at least a much smaller dataset for the wake word detection task. <strong>So in both of these cases, you’re transferring from a problem with a lot of data to a problem with relatively little data. One case where transfer learning would not make sense, is if the opposite was true</strong>. So, if you had a hundred images for image recognition and you had 100 images for radiology diagnosis or even a thousand images for radiology diagnosis, one would think about it is that to do well on radiology diagnosis, assuming what you really want to do well on this radiology diagnosis, having radiology images is much more valuable than having cat and dog and so on images. So each example here is much more valuable than each example there, at least for the purpose of building a good radiology system. So, if you already have more data for radiology, it’s not that likely that having 100 images of your random objects of cats and dogs and cars and so on will be that helpful, because the value of one example of image from your image recognition task of cats and dogs is just less valuable than one example of an x-ray image for the task of building a good radiology system. So, this would be one example where transfer learning, well, it might not hurt but I wouldn’t expect it to give you any meaningful gain either. And similarly, if you’d built a speech recognition system on 10 hours of data and you actually have 10 hours or maybe even more, say 50 hours of data for wake word detection, you know it won’t, it may or may not hurt, maybe it won’t hurt to include that 10 hours of data to your transfer learning, but you just wouldn’t expect to get a meaningful gain.</p><p><strong>So to summarize, when does transfer learning make sense? If you’re trying to learn from some Task A and transfer some of the knowledge to some Task B, then transfer learning makes sense when Task A and B have the same input X. In the first example, A and B both have images as input. In the second example, both have audio clips as input. It has to make sense when you have a lot more data for Task A than for Task B. All this is under the assumption that what you really want to do well on is Task B. And because data for Task B is more valuable for Task B, usually you just need a lot more data for Task A because you know, each example from Task A is just less valuable for Task B than each example for Task B. And then finally, transfer learning will tend to make more sense if you suspect that low level features from Task A could be helpful for learning Task B.</strong> And in both of the earlier examples, maybe learning image recognition teaches you enough about images to have a radiology diagnosis and maybe learning speech recognition teaches you about human speech to help you with trigger word or wake word detection.</p><p><strong>So to summarize, transfer learning has been most useful if you’re trying to do well on some Task B, usually a problem where you have relatively little data.</strong> So for example, in radiology, you know it’s difficult to get that many x-ray scans to build a good radiology diagnosis system. So in that case, you might find a related but different task, such as image recognition, where you can get maybe a million images and learn a lot of load-over features from that, so that you can then try to do well on Task B on your radiology task despite not having that much data for it. When transfer learning makes sense? It does help the performance of your learning task significantly. But I’ve also seen sometimes seen transfer learning applied in settings where Task A actually has less data than Task B and in those cases, you kind of don’t expect to see much of a gain.</p><p>So, that’s it for transfer learning where you learn from one task and try to transfer to a different task. There’s another version of learning from multiple tasks which is called multitask learning, which is when you try to learn from multiple tasks at the same time rather than learning from one and then sequentially, or after that, trying to transfer to a different task. So in the next video, let’s discuss multitasking learning.</p><h3 id="02-multi-task-learning"><a href="#02-multi-task-learning" class="headerlink" title="02_multi-task-learning"></a>02_multi-task-learning</h3><p>So whereas in transfer learning, you have a sequential process where you learn from task A and then transfer that to task B. <strong>In multi-task learning, you start off simultaneously, trying to have one neural network do several things at the same time. And then each of these task helps hopefully all of the other task</strong>. Let’s look at an example.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/20.png" alt=""><br>Let’s say you’re building an autonomous vehicle, building a self driving car. Then your self driving car would need to detect several different things such as pedestrians, detect other cars, detect stop signs. And also detect traffic lights and also other things. So for example, in this example on the left, there is a stop sign in this image and there is a car in this image but there aren’t any pedestrians or traffic lights. So if this image is an input for an example, x(i), then Instead of having one label y(i), you would actually a four labels. <strong>In this example, there are no pedestrians, there is a car, there is a stop sign and there are no traffic lights. And if you try and detect other things, there may be y(i) has even more dimensions. But for now let’s stick with these four. So y(i) is a 4 by 1 vector</strong>. And if you look at the training test labels as a whole, then similar to before, we’ll stack the training data’s labels horizontally as follows, y(1) up to y(m). Except that now y(i) is a 4 by 1 vector so each of these is a tall column vector. <strong>And so this matrix Y is now a 4 by m matrix, whereas previously, when y was single real number, this would have been a 1 by m matrix. So what you can do is now train a neural network to predict these values of y. So you can have a neural network input x and output now a four dimensional value for y.</strong> Notice here for the output there I’ve drawn four nodes.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/21.png" alt=""><br>And so the first node when we try to predict is there a pedestrian in this picture. The second output will predict is there a car here, predict is there a stop sign and this will predict maybe is there a traffic light. So y hat here is four dimensional. So to train this neural network, you now need to define the loss for the neural network. And so given a predicted output y hat i which is 4 by 1 dimensional. The loss averaged over your entire training set would be 1 over m sum from i = 1 through m, sum from j = 1 through 4 of the losses of the individual predictions. So it’s just summing over at the four components of pedestrian car stop sign traffic lights. And this script L is the usual logistic loss. So just to write this out, this is -yj i log y hat ji- 1- y log 1- y hat. And the main difference compared to the earlier binding classification examples is that you’re now summing over j equals 1 through 4. <strong>And the main difference between this and softmax regression, is that unlike softmax regression, which assigned a single label to single example. This one image can have multiple labels</strong>. So you’re not saying that each image is either a picture of a pedestrian, or a picture of car, a picture of a stop sign, picture of a traffic light. You’re asking for each picture, does it have a pedestrian, or a car a stop sign or traffic light, and multiple objects could appear in the same image. In fact, in the example on the previous slide, we had both a car and a stop sign in that image, but no pedestrians and traffic lights. So you’re not assigning a single label to an image, you’re going through the different classes and asking for each of the classes does that class, does that type of object appear in the image? So that’s why I’m saying that with this setting, one image can have multiple labels. <strong>If you train a neural network to minimize this cost function, you are carrying out multi-task learning. Because what you’re doing is building a single neural network that is looking at each image and basically solving four problems. It’s trying to tell you does each image have each of these four objects in it. And one other thing you could have done is just train four separate neural networks, instead of train one network to do four things. But if some of the earlier features in neural network can be shared between these different types of objects, then you find that training one neural network to do four things results in better performance than training four completely separate neural networks to do the four tasks separately. So that’s the power of multi-task learning.</strong></p><p>And one other detail, so far I’ve described this algorithm as if every image had every single label. <strong>It turns out that multi-task learning also works even if some of the images we’ll label only some of the objects.</strong> So the first training example, let’s say someone, your labeler had told you there’s a pedestrian, there’s no car, but they didn’t bother to label whether or not there’s a stop sign or whether or not there’s a traffic light. And maybe for the second example, there is a pedestrian, there is a car, but again the labeler, when they looked at that image, they just didn’t label it, whether it had a stop sign or whether it had a traffic light, and so on. <strong>And maybe some examples are fully labeled, and maybe some examples, they were just labeling for the presence and absence of cars so there’s some question marks, and so on. So with a data set like this, you can still train your learning algorithm to do four tasks at the same time, even when some images have only a subset of the labels and others are sort of question marks or don’t cares.</strong> And the way you train your algorithm, even when some of these labels are question marks or really unlabeled is that in this sum over j from 1 to 4, you would sum only over values of j with a 0 or 1 label. <strong>So whenever there’s a question mark, you just omit that term from summation but just sum over only the values where there is a label. And so that allows you to use datasets like this as well</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/22.png" alt=""><br>So when does multi-task learning makes sense? So when does multi-task learning make sense? I’ll say it makes sense usually when three things are true. One is if your training on a set of tasks that could benefit from having shared low-level features. So for the autonomous driving example, it makes sense that recognizing traffic lights and cars and pedestrians, those should have similar features that could also help you recognize stop signs, because these are all features of roads. Second, this is less of a hard and fast rule, so this isn’t always true. But what I see from a lot of successful multi-task learning settings is that the amount of data you have for each task is quite similar. So if you recall from transfer learning, you learn from some task A and transfer it to some task B. So if you have a million examples of task A then and 1,000 examples for task B, then all the knowledge you learned from that million examples could really help augment the much smaller data set you have for task B. Well how about multi-task learning? In multi-task learning you usually have a lot more tasks than just two. So maybe you have, previously we had 4 tasks but let’s say you have 100 tasks. And you’re going to do multi-task learning to try to recognize 100 different types of objects at the same time. So what you may find is that you may have 1,000 examples per task and so if you focus on the performance of just one task, let’s focus on the performance on the 100th task, you can call A100. If you are trying to do this final task in isolation, you would have had just a thousand examples to train this one task, this one of the 100 tasks that by training on these 99 other tasks. These in aggregate have 99,000 training examples which could be a big boost, could give a lot of knowledge to argument this otherwise, relatively small 1,000 example training set that you have for task A100. And symmetrically every one of the other 99 tasks can provide some data or provide some knowledge that help every one of the other tasks in this list of 100 tasks. So the second bullet isn’t a hard and fast rule but what I tend to look at is if you focus on any one task, for that to get a big boost for multi-task learning, the other tasks in aggregate need to have quite a lot more data than for that one task. And so one way to satisfy that is if a lot of tasks like we have in this example on the right, and if the amount of data you have in each task is quite similar. But the key really is that if you already have 1,000 examples for 1 task, then for all of the other tasks you better have a lot more than 1,000 examples if those other other task are meant to help you do better on this final task. And finally multi-task learning tends to make more sense when you can train a big enough neural network to do well on all the tasks. So the alternative to multi-task learning would be to train a separate neural network for each task. So rather than training one neural network for pedestrian, car, stop sign, and traffic light detection, you could have trained one neural network for pedestrian detection, one neural network for car detection, one neural network for stop sign detection, and one neural network for traffic light detection. So what a researcher, Rich Carona, found many years ago was that the only times multi-task learning hurts performance compared to training separate neural networks is if your neural network isn’t big enough. But if you can train a big enough neural network, then multi-task learning certainly should not or should very rarely hurt performance. And hopefully it will actually help performance compared to if you were training neural networks to do these different tasks in isolation.</p><p><strong>So that’s it for multi-task learning. In practice, multi-task learning is used much less often than transfer learning. I see a lot of applications of transfer learning where you have a problem you want to solve with a small amount of data. So you find a related problem with a lot of data to learn something and transfer that to this new problem. But multi-task learning is just more rare that you have a huge set of tasks you want to use that you want to do well on, you can train all of those tasks at the same time. Maybe the one example is computer vision. In object detection I see more applications of multi-task any where one neural network trying to detect a whole bunch of objects at the same time works better than different neural networks trained separately to detect objects. But I would say that on average transfer learning is used much more today than multi-task learning, but both are useful tools to have in your arsenal</strong>.</p><p>So to summarize, multi-task learning enables you to train one neural network to do many tasks and this can give you better performance than if you were to do the tasks in isolation. <strong>Now one note of caution, in practice I see that transfer learning is used much more often than multi-task learning. So I do see a lot of tasks where if you want to solve a machine learning problem but you have a relatively small data set, then transfer learning can really help. Where if you find a related problem but you have a much bigger data set, you can train in your neural network from there and then transfer it to the problem where we have very low data. So transfer learning is used a lot today. There are some applications of transfer multi-task learning as well, but multi-task learning I think is used much less often than transfer learning. And maybe the one exception is computer vision object detection, where I do see a lot of applications of training a neural network to detect lots of different objects. And that works better than training separate neural networks and detecting the visual objects</strong>. But on average I think that even though transfer learning and multi-task learning often you’re presented in a similar way, <strong>in practice I’ve seen a lot more applications of transfer learning than of multi-task learning. I think because often it’s just difficult to set up or to find so many different tasks that you would actually want to train a single neural network for.</strong> Again, with some sort of computer vision, object detection examples being the most notable exception. So that’s it for multi-task learning. Multi-task learning and transfer learning are both important tools to have in your tool bag. And finally, I’d like to move on to discuss end-to-end deep learning. So let’s go onto the next video to discuss end-to-end learning.</p><h2 id="04-end-to-end-deep-learning"><a href="#04-end-to-end-deep-learning" class="headerlink" title="04_end-to-end-deep-learning"></a>04_end-to-end-deep-learning</h2><h3 id="01-what-is-end-to-end-deep-learning"><a href="#01-what-is-end-to-end-deep-learning" class="headerlink" title="01_what-is-end-to-end-deep-learning"></a>01_what-is-end-to-end-deep-learning</h3><p>One of the most exciting recent developments in deep learning, has been the rise of end-to-end deep learning. So what is the end-to-end learning? <strong>Briefly, there have been some data processing systems, or learning systems that require multiple stages of processing. And what end-to-end deep learning does, is it can take all those multiple stages, and replace it usually with just a single neural network</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/23.png" alt=""><br>Let’s look at some examples. Take speech recognition as an example, where your goal is to take an input X such an audio clip, and map it to an output Y, which is a transcript of the audio clip. <strong>So traditionally, speech recognition required many stages of processing. First, you will extract some features, some hand-designed features of the audio</strong>. So if you’ve heard of MFCC, that’s an algorithm for extracting a certain set of hand designed features for audio. <strong>And then having extracted some low level features</strong>, you might apply a machine learning algorithm, to find the phonemes in the audio clip. <strong>So phonemes are the basic units of sound.</strong> So for example, the word cat is made out of three sounds. The Cu- Ah- and Tu- so they extract those. <strong>And then you string together phonemes to form individual words. And then you string those together to form the transcripts of the audio clip. So, in contrast to this pipeline with a lot of stages, what end-to-end deep learning does, is you can train a huge neural network to just input the audio clip, and have it directly output the transcript.</strong> One interesting sociological effect in AI is that as end-to-end deep learning started to work better, there were some researchers that had for example spent many years of their career designing individual steps of the pipeline. So there were some researchers in different disciplines not just in speech recognition. Maybe in computer vision, and other areas as well, that had spent a lot of time you know, written multiple papers, maybe even built a large part of their career, engineering featuresor engineering other pieces of the pipeline. And when end-to-end deep learning just took the last training set and learned the function mapping from x and y directly, really bypassing a lot of these intermediate steps, it was challenging for some disciplines to come around to accepting this alternative way of building AI systems. Because it really obsoleted in some cases, many years of research in some of the intermediate components. <strong>It turns out that one of the challenges of end-to-end deep learning is that you might need a lot of data before it works well.</strong> So for example, if you’re training on 3,000 hours of data to build a speech recognition system, then the traditional pipeline, the full traditional pipeline works really well. It’s only when you have a very large data set, you know one to say 10,000 hours of data, anything going up to maybe 100,000 hours of data that the end-to end-approach then suddenly starts to work really well. <strong>So when you have a smaller data set, the more traditional pipeline approach actually works just as well. Often works even better. And you need a large data set before the end-to-end approach really shines. And if you have a medium amount of data, then there are also intermediate approaches where maybe you input audio and bypass the features and just learn to output the phonemes of the neural network, and then at some other stages as well. So this will be a step toward end-to-end learning, but not all the way there</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/24.png" alt=""><br>So this is a picture of <strong>a face recognition turnstile</strong> built by a researcher, Yuanqing Lin at Baidu, where this is a camera and it looks at the person approaching the gate, and if it recognizes the person then, you know the turnstile automatically lets them through. So rather than needing to swipe an RFID badge to enter this facility, in increasingly many offices in China and hopefully more and more in other countries as well, you can just approach the turnstile and if it recognizes your face it just lets you through without needing you to carry an RFID badge. So, how do you build a system like this? Well, one thing you could do is just look at the image that the camera is capturing. Right? So, I guess this is my bad drawing, but maybe this is a camera image. And you know, you have <strong>someone approaching the turnstile. So this might be the image X that you that your camera is capturing. And one thing you could do is try to learn a function mapping directly from the image X to the identity of the person Y. It turns out this is not the best approach. And one of the problems is that you know, the person approaching the turnstile can approach from lots of different directions</strong>. So they could be green positions, they could be in blue position. You know, sometimes they’re closer to the camera, so they appear bigger in the image. And sometimes they’re already closer to the camera, so that face appears much bigger. <strong>So what it has actually done to build these turnstiles, is not to just take the raw image and feed it to a neural net to try to figure out a person’s identity. Instead, the best approach to date, seems to be a multi-step approach, where first, you run one piece of software to detect the person’s face. So this first detector to figure out where’s the person’s face. Having detected the person’s face, you then zoom in to that part of the image and crop that image so that the person’s face is centered.</strong> Then, it is this picture that I guess I drew here in red, this is then fed to the neural network, to then try to learn, or estimate the person’s identity. <strong>And what researchers have found, is that instead of trying to learn everything on one step, by breaking this problem down into two simpler steps, first is figure out where is the face. And second, is look at the face and figure out who this actually is. This second approach allows the learning algorithm or really two learning algorithms to solve two much simpler tasks and results in overall better performance</strong>. By the way, if you want to know how the second step actually works I’ve simplified the discussion. By the way, if you want to know how step two here actually works, I’ve actually simplified the description a bit. <strong>The way the second step is actually trained, as you train in your network, that takes as input two images, and what then your network does is it takes this input two images and it tells you if these two are the same person or not. So if you then have say 10,000 employees IDs on file, you can then take this image in red, and quickly compare it against maybe all 10,000 employee IDs on file to try to figure out if this picture in red is indeed one of your 10000 employees that you should allow into this facility or that should allow into your office building.</strong> This is a turnstile that is giving employees access to a workplace.<strong>So why is it that the two step approach works better? There are actually two reasons for that. One is that each of the two problems you’re solving is actually much simpler. But second, is that you have a lot of data for each of the two sub-tasks. In particular, there is a lot of data you can obtain for phase detection, for task one over here, where the task is to look at an image and figure out where is the person’s face and the image. So there is a lot of data.</strong> There is a lot of label data X, comma Y where X is a picture and y shows the position of the person’s face. <strong>So you could build a neural network to do task one quite well. And then separately, there’s a lot of data for task two as well. Today, leading companies have let’s say, hundreds of millions of pictures of people’s faces. So given a closely cropped image</strong>, like this red image or this one down here, today leading face recognition teams have at least hundreds of millions of images that they could use to look at two images and try to figure out the identity or to figure out if it’s the same person or not. <strong>So there’s also a lot of data for task two. But in contrast, if you were to try to learn everything at the same time, there is much less data of the form X comma Y. Where X is image like this taken from the turnstile, and Y is the identity of the person. So because you don’t have enough data to solve this end-to-end learning problem, but you do have enough data to solve sub-problems one and two, in practice, breaking this down to two sub-problems results in better performance than a pure end-to-end deep learning approach. Although if you had enough data for the end-to-end approach, maybe the end-to-end approach would work better, but that’s not actually what works best in practice today.</strong></p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/25.png" alt=""><br>Let’s look at a few more examples. Take machine translation. Traditionally, machine translation systems also had a long complicated pipeline, where you first take say English, text and then do text analysis. Basically, extract a bunch of features off the text, and so on. And after many many steps you’d end up with say, a translation of the English text into French. Because, for machine translation, you do have a lot of pairs of English comma French sentences. <strong>End-to-end deep learning works quite well for machine translation. And that’s because today, it is possible to gather large data sets of X-Y pairs where that’s the English sentence and that’s the corresponding French translation. So in this example, end-to-end deep learning works well.</strong></p><p>One last example, let’s say that you want to look at an X-ray picture of a hand of a child, and estimate the age of a child. You know, when I first heard about this problem, I thought this is a very cool crime scene investigation task where you find maybe tragically the skeleton of a child, and you want to figure out how the child was. <strong>It turns out that typical application of this problem, estimating age of a child from an X-ray is less dramatic than this crime scene investigation I was picturing</strong>. It turns out that pediatricians use this to estimate whether or not a child is growing or developing normally. But a non end-to-end approach to this, would be you locate an image and then you segment out or recognize the bones. So, just try to figure out where is that bone segment? Where is that bone segment? Where is that bone segment? And so on. And then. Knowing the lengths of the different bones, you can sort of go to a look up table showing the average bone lengths in a child’s hand and then use that to estimate the child’s age. <strong>And so this approach actually works pretty well. In contrast, if you were to go straight from the image to the child’s age, then you would need a lot of data to do that directly and as far as I know, this approach does not work as well today just because there isn’t enough data to train this task in an end-to-end fashion. Whereas in contrast, you can imagine that by breaking down this problem into two steps.</strong> Step one is a relatively simple problem. Maybe you don’t need that much data. Maybe you don’t need that many X-ray images to segment out the bones. And task two, by collecting statistics of a number of children’s hands, you can also get decent estimates of that without too much data. <strong>So this multi-step approach seems promising. Maybe more promising than the end-to-end approach, at least until you can get more data for the end-to-end learning approach.</strong></p><p><strong>So an end-to-end deep learning works. It can work really well and it can really simplify the system and not require you to build so many hand-designed individual components. But it’s also not panacea, it doesn’t always work.</strong> In the next video, I want to share with you a more systematic description of when you should, and maybe when you shouldn’t use end-to-end deep learning and how to piece together these complex machine learning systems.</p><h3 id="02-whether-to-use-end-to-end-deep-learning"><a href="#02-whether-to-use-end-to-end-deep-learning" class="headerlink" title="02_whether-to-use-end-to-end-deep-learning"></a>02_whether-to-use-end-to-end-deep-learning</h3><p>Let’s say in building a machine learning system you’re trying to decide whether or not to use an end-to-end approach. Let’s take a look at some of the pros and cons of end-to-end deep learning so that you can come away with some guidelines on whether or not an end-to-end approach seems promising for your application.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/26.png" alt=""><br>Here are some of the <strong>benefits</strong> of applying end-to-end learning. <strong>First is that end-to-end learning really just lets the data speak</strong>. So if you have enough X,Y data then whatever is the most appropriate function mapping from X to Y, if you train a big enough neural network, hopefully the neural network will figure it out. And by having a pure machine learning approach, your neural network learning input from X to Y may be more able to capture whatever statistics are in the data, rather than being forced to reflect human preconceptions. So for example, in the case of speech recognition earlier speech systems had this notion of a phoneme which was a basic unit of sound like C, A, and T for the word cat. And I think that phonemes are an artifact created by human linguists. I actually think that phonemes are a fantasy of linguists that are a reasonable description of language, but it’s not obvious that you want to force your learning algorithm to think in phonemes. And if you let your learning algorithm learn whatever representation it wants to learn rather than forcing your learning algorithm to use phonemes as a representation, then its overall performance might end up being better. <strong>The second benefit to end-to-end deep learning is that there’s less hand designing of components needed. And so this could also simplify your design work flow, that you just don’t need to spend a lot of time hand designing features, hand designing these intermediate representations</strong>.</p><p>How about the <strong>disadvantages</strong>. Here are some of the cons. <strong>First, it may need a large amount of data</strong>. So to learn this X to Y mapping directly, you might need a lot of data of X, Y and we were seeing in a previous video some examples of where you could obtain a lot of data for subtasks. Such as for face recognition, we could find a lot data for finding a face in the image, as well as identifying the face once you found a face, but there was just less data available for the entire end-to-end task. So X, this is the input end of the end-to-end learning and Y is the output end. And so you need all the data X Y with both the input end and the output end in order to train these systems, and this is why we call it end-to-end learning value as well because you’re learning a direct mapping from one end of the system all the way to the other end of the system. <strong>The other disadvantage is that it excludes potentially useful hand designed components</strong>. So machine learning researchers tend to speak disparagingly of hand designing things. But if you don’t have a lot of data, then your learning algorithm doesn’t have that much insight it can gain from your data. <strong>If your training set is small. And so hand designing a component can really be a way for you to inject manual knowledge into the algorithm, and that’s not always a bad thing.</strong> I think of a learning algorithm as having two main sources of knowledge. One is the data and the other is whatever you hand design, be it components, or features, or other things. And so when you have a ton of data it’s less important to hand design things but when you don’t have much data, then having a carefully hand-designed system can actually allow humans to inject a lot of knowledge about the problem into an algorithm deck and that should be very helpful. So one of the downsides of end-to-end deep learning is that it excludes potentially useful hand-designed components. <strong>And hand-designed components could be very helpful if well designed. They could also be harmful if it really limits your performance, such as if you force an algorithm to think in phonemes when maybe it could have discovered a better representation by itself. So it’s kind of a double edged sword that could hurt or help but it does tend to help more, hand-designed components tend to help more when you’re training on a small training set</strong>.</p><p><strong>So if you’re building a new machine learning system and you’re trying to decide whether or not to use end-to-end deep learning, I think the key question is, do you have sufficient data to learn the function of the complexity needed to map from X to Y?</strong></p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/27.png" alt=""><br>I don’t have a formal definition of this phrase, <strong>complexity</strong> needed, but intuitively, if you’re trying to learn a function from X to Y, that is looking at an image like this and <strong>recognizing the position of the bones in this image</strong>, then maybe this seems like a relatively simple problem to identify the bones of the image and maybe they’ll need that much data for that task. Or given a picture of a person, maybe finding the face of that person in the image doesn’t seem like that hard a problem, so maybe you don’t need too much data to find the face of a person. Or at least maybe you can find enough data to solve that task, <strong>whereas in contrast, the function needed to look at the hand and map that directly to the age of the child, that seems like a much more complex problem that intuitively maybe you need more data to learn if you were to apply a pure end-to-end deep learning approach</strong>.</p><p><img src="http://q6gm8fomw.bkt.clouddn.com/gitpage/deeplearning.ai/StructuringMachineLearningProjects/02_ml-strategy-2/28.png" alt=""><br>So let me finish this video with a more complex example. You may know that I’ve been spending time helping out an <strong>autonomous driving</strong> company, Drive.ai. So I’m actually very excited about autonomous driving. So how do you build a car that drives itself? Well, here’s one thing you could do, and this is not an end-to-end deep learning approach. You can take as input an image of what’s in front of your car, maybe radar, lighter, other sensor readings as well, but to simplify the description, let’s just say you take a picture of what’s in front or what’s around your car. And then to drive your car safely you need to <strong>detect other cars</strong> and you also need to <strong>detect pedestrians</strong>. You need to <strong>detect other things</strong>, of course, but we’ll just present a simplified example here. <strong>Having figured out where are the other cars and pedestrians, you then need to plan your own route.</strong> So in other words, if you see where are the other cars, where are the pedestrians, <strong>you need to decide how to steer your own car, what path to steer your own car for the next several seconds.</strong> And having decided that you’re going to drive a certain path, maybe this is a top down view of a road and that’s your car. Maybe you’ve decided to drive that path, that’s what a route is, then you need to execute this by generating the appropriate steering, as well as acceleration and braking commands. So in going from your image or your sensory inputs to detecting cars and pedestrians, that can be done pretty well using deep learning, but then <strong>having figured out where the other cars and pedestrians are going, to select this route to exactly how you want to move your car, usually that’s not to done with deep learning. Instead that’s done with a piece of software called Motion Planning</strong>. And if you ever take a course in robotics you’ll learn about <strong>motion planning</strong>. <strong>And then having decided what’s the path you want to steer your car through, there’ll be some other algorithm, we’re going to say it’s a control algorithm that then generates the exact decision, that then decides exactly how much to turn the steering wheel and how much to step on the accelerator or step on the brake</strong>. So I think what this example illustrates is that you want to use machine learning or use deep learning to learn some individual components and when applying supervised learning you should carefully choose what types of X to Y mappings you want to learn depending on what task you can get data for. And in contrast, it is exciting to talk about a pure end-to-end deep learning approach where you input the image and directly output a steering. But given data availability and the types of things we can learn with neural networks today, this is actually not the most promising approach or this is not an approach that I think teams have gotten to work best. <strong>And I think this pure end-to-end deep learning approach is actually less promising than more sophisticated approaches like this, given the availability of data and our ability to train neural networks today</strong>.</p><p>So that’s it for end-to-end deep learning. It can sometimes work really well but you also have to be mindful of where you apply end-to-end deep learning. Finally, thank you and congrats on making it this far with me. If you finish last week’s videos and this week’s videos then I think you will already be much smarter and much more strategic and much more able to make good prioritization decisions in terms of how to move forward on your machine learning project, even compared to a lot of machine learning engineers and researchers that I see here in Silicon Valley. So congrats on all that you’ve learned so far and I hope you now also take a look at this week’s homework problems which should give you another opportunity to practice these ideas and make sure that you’re mastering them.</p>
